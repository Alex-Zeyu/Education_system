However, the patient has no injury history and cannot abduct his arm at all - not even up to 15 degrees.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B) Again, could be correct.

When this ligament calcifies, it closes the suprascapular notch into a foramen which compresses the suprascapular nerve.

This is why it is more likely to be the Olfactory nerve that is affected, rather than the Facial nerve which provides sense of taste to the anterior 2/3rd of the tongue, or the Glossopharyngeal nerve which provides taste to the posterior 1/3rd.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve is responsible from sensory innervation of the upper face, including the&nbsp;mucous membranes and sinuses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Hypoglossal nerve is responsible for motor innervation of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Extra Info:</p><p>The suspected mechanism by which COVID causes loss of smell is via damage to the supporting cells of the olfactory receptors. The receptors of the olfactory nerve are supported by glial cells known as Olfactory Ensheathing Cells (OECs) which myelinate the receptors and help maintain their health and function. These OEC's have been found to have a surface protein ACE-2 which can be targeted by the COVID-19 virus, allowing them to be damaged. Damage to these OEC's result in poor functioning of the olfactory receptors themselves, causing a loss in the ability to smell, and consequently taste.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, these cells do regenerate fairly quickly so the sense of smell will usually return a few weeks or months following the infection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Info coming from this video:&nbsp;<a class=""enteredLink"" href=""https://youtu.be/QBMZM1kVLD4"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/QBMZM1kVLD4</a></p>","For Fun, PCS 3, Head and neck"

Yay!</p><p>The Vestibulocochlear nerve is responsible for balance (vestibular branch of the nerve) and hearing (cochlear branch of the nerve).<br />The Cochlear nerve innervates the hair cells of the organ of Corti in the spirals of the cochlea. (TIP: Cochlear nerve to do with the Cochlea (spiral bit in the ear).)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Deduction</strong></span><br />However, this question is asking about which nerve innervates a muscle that is attached to the Stapes. Not about anything to do with the Cochlea.<br />Therefore, by the powers of deduction, you are left with the Facial nerve, which is the correct answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Addition information</strong></span><br />This question was adapted from Geeky medic who provided the following question and explanation:<br />Which of the following cranial nerves supplies stapedius?<br />Answer: Facial Nerve<br />Explanation: &ldquo;Stapedius is a small muscle that inserts on the neck of the stapes and reduces the oscillatory range. As with many muscles in the head and neck, it is innervated by the facial nerve. When the facial nerve is damaged, the stapedius may become paralysed, increasing the oscillatory range and causing hyperacusis.&rdquo;</p><p>https://geekyquiz.com<br />I hope all of that is clear and you enjoyed learning something new.

Increased intracellular calcium increase inotropy in the heart through calcium-induced exchange facilitated by the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Cardiac output increases with a subsequent decrease in ventricular filling pressures.<br />Digoxin also has vagomimetic effects on the AV node. By stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system, it slows electrical conduction in the atrioventricular node, therefore, decreases the heart rate. The rise in calcium levels leads to prolongation of phase 4, and phase 0 of the cardiac action potential thus increases the refractory period of the AV node.

This is because the time needed for equilibration between alveolar and capillary oxygen is much less than the transit time of RBCs in the pulmonary capillary network.

Second degree atrioventricular heart block is intermittent failure of excitation to pass to the ventricles. There are a few subdivisions of second degree heart block, one of which being Mobitz type I heart block, caused by malfunctioning AV nodal cells which progressively fatigue until they completely fail to conduct an impulse.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>C - Mobitz type II heart block is a form of second degree atrioventricular heart block characterised by intermittent non-conducted P-waves without progressive elongation of the PR interval, as is seen in type I.

Third degree heart block will happen if Mobitz type I or II are left to continue untreated for a long time, and can lead to sudden cardiac death and so is very serious. None of the impulses from the SA node are conducted to the ventricles, and so they contract independently to atria, in either junctional or ventricular escape rhythm.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>E -&nbsp;Branch bundle heart block refers to impairment of the conduction to the ventricles in the bundle of His or its branches.

The three main signs of this are dyspnoea, chronic cough and sputum production. Patients may also experience wheezing and a tight chest. Their symptoms do not improve with a bronchodilator, which rules out asthma. Chronic bronchitis is where the airways irreversibly bronchoconstrict, reducing the lumen and increasing resistance. There is hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucous glands and goblet cells. This leads to mucous hypersecretion which further decreases the lumen and increases resistance. Alveolar hypoxia leads to pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension. Low oxygen and carbon dioxide result in hypoxaemia and hypercapnia. Hypercapnia can cause respiratory acidosis and hypoxaemia can cause polycthemia (increased haemoglobin). Low oxygen leads to central cyanosis and patients are described as blue bloaters.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>C- Emphysema patients have purse lipped breathing and muscle wasting.

The interstitium is the space between the alveolar epithelium and the capillary endothelial basement membrane. There is an infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells which causes degradation of alveoli. This creates multiple filled air spaces which have a honeycomb appearance. This is what is seen on the CT scan. Due to the loss of alveoli, there is reduced lung volume and elasticity which reduces FVC and FEV1.

The telencephalon is the&nbsp;<em>top part</em> of the forebrain or prosencephalon, comprising the cerebral hemispheres together with the olfactory lobes and olfactory bulbs.

This is an obstructive lung disease caused by inflammation of the airways. Mucous secretion increases which narrows the lumen and increases resistance. Macrophages are recruited and release TNF-alpha which increases vascular permeability, and CXCL8 attracts neutrophils. Neutrophils secrete elastase and proteases which break down elastin fibres and damages the airways, including the cilia. Cilia damage prevents them from sweeping the mucous out of the airways and this results in a productive cough. The colour of the sputum is green due to the neutrophils present. Once the airway is damaged, it is more prone to infections so patients may have recurrent chest infections. Bronchiectasis can be caused by a pulmonary infection such as pneumonia. Other causes include: alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis, COPD and asthma. Bronchiectasis cannot be cured but can be managed with regular antibiotics and bronchodilators.&nbsp;</p>","Case 3"

This is where the HPG axis has been activated but the HPA axis has not. FSH and LH levels are elevated due to low testosterone and oestrogen levels, which are not inhibiting FSH and LH release from the anterior pituitary. This is due to less negative feedback on the hypothalamus as testosterone levels are low and high testosterone normally inhibits GnRH release. It is known as primary gonadal failure which could be caused by damage to the gonads. To treat this sex steroids may be used to accelerate pubertal development&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A- Central precocious puberty: this is early puberty caused by the early activation of the HPG axis leading to GnRH release and FSH and LH release which activates the HPA axis. Children with this condition may appear very tall, have advance skeletal maturation, sex steroid characteristics (pubic hair, axillary hair and mood swings)</p><p>C- Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism: this is where there is failure to switch on the HPG axis leading to failure to activate the HPA axis.

It is an NMDA receptor antagonist. Glutamatergic excitotoxicity causes neuronal death and this can be mediated through pathological NMDA receptor activation. Memantine suppresses the NMDA activity. Blockage of the nAChR sounds counter intuitive as it's what is happening in other drugs but the brain up-regulates nAChR in the presence of memantine to counteract its blockade. This enhances ACh-mediated neurotransmission.&nbsp;</p><p>It is contraindicated in epileptics.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other drugs used to treat dementia are donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine.

FBPase2 will convert fructose 2,6 biphosphate into fructose 6 phosphate(F6P).<br />- Fructose 2,6 biphosphate can increase PFK's affinity for F6P and reduce its affinity to ATP. Without it, the PFK will not be able to bind to as many F6P.<br />- This will reduce the rate of glycolysis and increase the rate of glyconeogenesis to convert lactate back into glucose which could be depleted quickly otherwise in the cells.<br />- There will then be an increase in glucose released into blood-higher blood sugar level caused by glucagon.</p><p>Cycle 2:</p><p>- Low numbers of Fru2,6 BP(corresponded with high F6P number)can lead to low rate of glycolysis but high rate of gluconeogenesis will increase the blood glucose level.<br />- This will trigger the release of insulin and reduction in the release of glucagon.<br />- PFKA2 will no longer become inhibited and instead FBPase2 will be phosphorylated by phosphoprotein phosphatase.<br />- This will convert F6P back into Fructose 2,6 biphosphate.<br />- The infinity of PFK to F6P will increase as well as reducing the inhibitory effect of ATP. This increases the rate of glycolysis.<br />- As a result, the rate of gluconeogenesis will be further reduced as lactate must be made from glycolysis first.<br />- This means the blood sugar level will decrease and this will trigger the release of glucagon.<br />- This marks the start of cycle 1.</p><p>Cycle 1 indicates the main cycle: as liver often have a high rate of gluconeogenesis so it needs to keep glycolysis low.</p><p>Cycle 2 will convert back to cycle 1.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A: ATP indicates high energy state and glycolysis is prevented to create too much energy, it is also only useful in other cells, not liver</p><p>B: Can be a correct answer, however, AMP only encourages glycolysis in other cells.

A tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) which converts plasminogen to plasmin, which breaks down fibrin in a clot. This would be administered if someone was suffering from unstable angina, where a stable plaque has ruptured to form a thrombus. Alteplase would then break down a thrombus or part of a thrombus which has detached from the unstable plaque (embolism) via the MOA mentioned above. This would be ineffective in removing a stable plaque seen in stable angina. A clot hasn't formed around the atherosclerotic plaque in stable angina. A stable plaque is an accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in the sub endothelium of a blood vessel, surrounded by a thick fibrous cap. An unstable plaque is one which has ruptured, the fibrous cap has been broken.</li></ul>","ECG, Pharmacology, Cardiac, Heart, Case 2"

She is tachycardic, has a high fever and a very low blood pressure. These are caused by bacteria, from Carol's UTI, entering her blood stream. Her immune system has produced excess TNF-alpha which has increased vascular permeability too much, causing fluid to enter tissues and her blood pressure to drop. To compensate, her heart is beating faster in response to reduced blood flow in the carotid sinus and arch of aorta. Cytokines IL-1 have acted on the hypothalamus and caused a fever.

The influx of Na+ ions depolarizes the cell further causing the opening of more Na+ channels. These channels then close almost immediately after</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phase 1</strong> - Notch:&nbsp;These transient opening K+ channels rapidly repolarise the cell before the plateau phase. Therefore they set the membrane potential of the plateau phase. Greater K+ currents during this notch phase allow more repolarisation so that the plateau occurs at lower voltages. Fewer K+ currents means that less repolarisation occurs and the plateau phase occurs at higher voltages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phase 2</strong> - Plateau:&nbsp;L-type Ca2+ channels are located in the T-tubules that penetrate the cell. These channels are in close proximity to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Therefore the Ca2+ that enters through them binds to ryanodine receptors located on the SR.This triggers massive Ca2+ release from the SR through a channel in the ryanodine receptor. This phenomenon is called calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). The majority (75%) of Ca2+ that enters the cell comes from the SR. CICR is essential for excitation-contraction coupling within the cell. Calcium ions bind to troponin C and initiate the movement of tropomyosin away from the myosin head binding site on the actin molecule &ndash; permitting contraction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phase 3</strong> - Repolarisation:&nbsp;As Ca2+ channels close, K+ currents succeed in repolarising the cell, driving the membrane potential toward EK. During this phase, Na+ channels will begin to recover from inactivation as the membrane potential becomes more negative. This permits the cycle to restart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Information above was taken from here:&nbsp;<a class=""enteredLink"" href=""https://teachmephysiology.com/cardiovascular-system/cardiac-cycle-2/action-potential-ventricular-cells/"" target=""_blank"">https://teachmephysiology.com/cardiovascular-system/cardiac-cycle-2/action-potential-ventricular-cells/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""https://www.wikidoc.org/images/8/80/Ventricular_action_potential.png"" alt="""" /></p><p><img src=""https://teachmephysiology.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ventricular-ap-1.gif"" alt="""" /></p>","Cardiac, Cardiac Cycle, Cardiology, Case 2"

Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease are associated with an abnormal build up of the same protein.

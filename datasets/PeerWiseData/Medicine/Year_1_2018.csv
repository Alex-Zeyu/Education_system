Parasympathetic stimulation promotes secretion of saliva and increases blood flow to salivary glands. However sympathetic stimulation has a variable effect.

Both cephalosporins and penicillins are beta-lactam antibiotics since they both have a similar structure to a beta-lactam ring. They inhibit the transpeptidase through binding to the penicillin-binding protein (PBP), preventing a cross-linking of the peptidoglycan layer. Bacteria can become resistant to these antibiotics through an expression of a different PBP (an example being staph aureus) or through a beta-lactamase enzyme.

In an in-tact blood vessel, platelets and von Willebrand factor circulate but don&rsquo;t interact with each other or the vessel wall as the endothelium prevents contact with the subendothelium. However, if the blood vessel is damaged, the collagen of the subendothelium is exposed and von Willebrand factor can bind to it, changing the formation of the von Willebrand factor so that platelets can now bind to it. This leads to platelet activation, which has 3 effects. Firstly, the platelets become a pointier star shape, which increases surface area and helps with interlacing. Secondly, it releases molecules that encourage more platelets to bind to von Willebrand factor and activate. Lastly, the platelet&rsquo;s surfaces become negatively charged. Certain chemicals such as ADP and thrombin can also cause platelet activation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Secondary haemostasis is the formation of a hard clot by the deposition of fibrin. There are two interlinked models for this: the classical model (which is no longer believed) and the cell-based model. In the classical model, the intrinsic pathway is when many coagulation factors activate other coagulation factors until prothrombin is converted to thrombin. This converts fibrinogen to fibrin, which can be deposited on the soft clot. <strong>The extrinsic pathway is similar because it cumulates in the formation of thrombin then fibrin but it involves an extra protein known as tissue factor, which is released from damaged tissues.</strong> The cell-based model is similar but it involves 3 stages. The first stage is initiation, which occurs all the time. Coagulation factors diffuse from the blood into the vessel wall where they become activated and can lead to the formation of a small amount of thrombin that will remain until the vessel is damaged and clotting is necessary. Amplification is the next stage and it occurs when a vessel is damaged. Coagulation factors from the blood flow into the vessel wall and come into contact with the thrombin from initiation. Thrombin activates many of these coagulation factors, which then activate other coagulation factors. The final stage is propagation, whereby a complex of coagulation factors binds to negatively charged platelets. This leads to a series of reactions where eventually large amount of prothrombin are converted to thrombin, which then converts fibrinogen to fibrin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was in the learning outcomes from the PCS Unit 2 lecture &lsquo;Blood vessels; haemostasis&rsquo;.</p>","PCS unit 2, Haemostasis, Haemostatis"

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume of fluid filtered per unit time. The assessment of GFR can be used to assess the degree of kidney impairment and follow the disease.

Kf is determined by the hydraulic properties and the surface area).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Estimation of the GFR is used to assess the degree of kidney impairment and follow the disease but is not diagnostic (diagnosis is achieved through urine analysis, measurement of protein excretion rate, radiologic studies and renal biopsy). The significance of a declining GFR implies progression of a disease process or a superimposed and reversible problem eg reduced renal perfusion. There is no exact correlation between loss of kidney and loss of GFR (the kidney, in this case, would be able to compensate in the remaining nephrons). GFR quantitates the effectiveness of renal excretion and is approximate (the sum of all filtration rates of functioning nephrons). In men, expected is 130ml/min/1.73(meters squared). In women, expected is 120ml/min/1.73 (meters squared).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Measurement of GFR can be achieved by looking at the urinary clearance of a marker. Markers would have to be freely filtered at the glomerulus, nontoxic and neither secreted or absorbed by the kidney tubules, therefore, the filtered load of the marker is equal to the rate of urinary secretion. Inulin can be used and so can creatine (is derived from skeletal muscle, released relatively constantly into circulation, freely filtered in the glomerulus, not reabsorbed or metabolised, some secretion in the proximal tubule. If GFR, nephrons, diet and muscle mass are all constant, then plasma creatine is constant).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Estimation fo GFR improves on creatine through the incorporation of demographic changes. This is reasonably accurate over time but doesn't give accurate estimations when GFR is changing rapidly. The MDRD equation in Wales incorporates the four variables: age, gender, creatine and ethnicity. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://image.slidesharecdn.com/hivandrenalhealthdrjunodslidedeck07june13-140822131818-phpapp01/95/hiv-and-renal-health-with-dr-patrice-junod-clinique-mdicale-lactuel-21-638.jpg?cb=1408715704&nbsp;</p><p>https://image2.slideserve.com/3701286/determinants-of-glomerular-filtration-rate-n.jpg</p>","Case 2, kidneys"

If there is 5 large squares between beats the heart rate is 60bpm and if the gap between beats is 6 large squares then the gap is 50 bpm.

Astrocytes are involved in the blood-brain barrier (involved in the control of substances passing across the blood-brain barrier. Also involved in changing of blood vessel diameter depending on the activity of neuronal activity due to the release of vasodilative and vasoconstrictive substances).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Astrocytes are involved in the regulation of extracellular potassium ion levels and glutamate levels (potassium ion levels are regulated through the uptake of potassium through pumps and also the subsequent discharge of potassium into the extracellular space). Potassium ion levels must be kept around 2-2.5mM and glutamate levels to around 3mM. Astrocytes also regulate the concentrations of calium, chloride and water in the extracellular space.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Astrocytes provide metabolic support for neurones (converting glucose into lactate which can be taken up into the extracellular space and used by neruones) and are also involved in the development of the CNS.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Astrocytes in the chemosensory areas of the brain stem are highly sensitive to pH and hence release ATP to stimulate chemosensitive neurones to increase breathing (hence, astrocytes are responsible for the control of breathing).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pathologies associated with astrocytes include astrocytomas, astrogliosis and epilepsy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Calcium ions are important in all intracellular processes but not in action potentials. Intracellular calcium levels must be kept low. Intercellular calcium waves provide long-distance communication within the astrocyte network. If calcium ions control the overall neuroexcitability, then it needs to keep low since if high can lead to epilepsy. Ions of sodium, potassium and chloride are responsible for action potentials, however, calcium is an important messenger within the brain.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Microglial cells are the immune system of the brain. They are normally resting and become activated by brain injury. They are signalled by either inflammation or things released from decaying cell bodies. Populations migrate to the region and perform phagocytosis. This is smaller than other types of neuroglial cells in the CNS and is important since CNS neurones do not replicate and require protection from pathogens.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ependymal cells are ciliated cuboidal epithelial cells lining the ventricular system of the CNS.

Since the patient has never smoked, it is unlikely that they have a smoking-related disease such as severe fibrosis (eliminates e). Answer a is quite vague. It mentions clotting but does not specify where so potentially this may not affect the lungs. Answer d is the best answer since this condition results in an increased right ventricle workload (increases afterload). As more blood is in the right ventricle (increased right ventricular afterload), this increases right ventricular pressure. The right ventricle comes under strain and hence undergoes hypertrophy (compensation), dilates (decompensation) and tricuspid regurgitation and impairment of venous return can occur.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include tricuspid regurgitation murmur, raised JVP, pulsatile, tender liver, ascites (abdominal swelling), swelling of the legs and feet (peripheral oedema) and palpitations.&nbsp;</p><p>Other signs and symptoms include right ventricular heave (ie can feel the right ventricle), loud second heart sound, cyanosis and syncope (due to low cardiac output).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This can result in cor pulmonale which is the right ventricular enlargement secondary to a lung disorder causing the condition of pulmonary hypertesion (and is common in advanced emphysema and advanced pulmonary fibrosis).

Treatment for pulmonary hypertension can include treatment for the cause, vasodilator (in only some patients) and supportive treatments (ie oxygen therapy).

The release of dopamine is increased with the use of drugs (in this case alcohol) and repeated activation of this pathway leads to structural, functional and biochemical changes resulting in a loss of control. This pathway involves core structures of the limbic system and involves dopaminergic mesolimbic pathways.

Cravings can also result from a learning process whereby conditioned stimuli activate reward circuits.

Bilirubin is a breakdown product of haemoglobin and is conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver, to then be excreted in bile and entering the gut. The release of bile from the gall bladder is via the peptide hormone CCK. It is released from different cells in the duodenum and jejunum in response to fat entering the digestive tract.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which of the following cells are responsible for the release of CCK?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>Enterochromaffin cells</p>","<p>I cells</p>","<p>K cells</p>","<p>Parietal cells</p>","<p>S cells</p>","<p>Enterochromaffin cells: manually stimulated by the presence of chyme in the small intestine. They release serotonin which acts on the enteric nervous system to cause the activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane transporters. This ultimately results in the presence of sodium ions in the small intestine which is important for absorption.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>K cells: Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) in response to chyme entering the small intestine. GIP stimulates the release of insulin necessary for carbohydrate storage.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>S cells: secrete secretin in response to acidic pH of chyme in the small intestine. This induces the release of alkaline/ basic HCO3 from the pancreas (so, in essence, provides a neutralising reagent in response to the acidity of chyme) and inhibits gastric emptying.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I cells: release CCK in response to fat in the small intestine. CCK causes the contraction of the bile duct and also the release of pancreatic enzymes from the pancreas. The bile and pancreatic enzymes have a key role in lipid digestion (essentially, detects high levels of fat and induces a response that digests fat).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Parietal cell: Release of HCL in the stomach. Stimulated by acetylcholine release from the vagus nerve during the cephalic phase. Mainly stimulated by the release of gastrin from g cells in the stomach. Enterochromaffin-like cells also line the stomach and release histamine binding to parietal cells. Both acetylcholine and gastrin evoke calcium, whereas histamine evokes cAMP.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the bile duct, the epithelium act to remove water and salts in order to concentrate bile and the glandular epithelium has a thickened muscle layer (which likely explains why the bile duct contracts to release bile). During the bile product, Hb breaks down producing bilirubin. Unconjugated bilirubin then binds to albumin and circulates to the liver. Henceforth, the bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid (glucuronic acid is also used in the metabolism of different drugs during phase 2 of metabolism of the liver) to make the bilirubin water soluble and this occurs in hepatocytes. Furthermore, bilirubin is excreted in bile into the gut.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, functions of the liver include maintaining metabolic homeostasis (achieved through the cytoplasm of hepatocytes having enzymes), the storage of nutrients (such as glycogen, iron, copper and fat-soluble nutrients), the detoxification of harmful substances and bile synthesis.

The intensity of pain can be altered depending on the understanding placed upon pain (catastrophizing pain is linked to greater pain intensity and also predicts the development of chronic pain problems). An example of this was comparing an atheist group with a religious group in terms of their responses to pain when placing a religious picture in front subjects from each group.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Attention to pain refers to the painful stimuli receiving preferential neural processing (this is likely to govern behaviour). <br />The attention given to the stimulus can influence the experience of pain being that attention distractions reduce the intensity of pain due to reducing pain-related brain activity in the S1, S2, thalamus and increases activity in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and the periaqueductal grey (there is an overlap between attention systems and descending pain modulatory systems). To provide an example of this, when I was young and a doctor needed to take a sample of blood, the nurse distracted me and hadn't told me I was going to have my blood taken. As I was oblivious to my blood being taken, I felt no pain during the procedure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Emotions influence pain. An acute fight or flight response may dampen pain via the release of noradrenaline and activation of the PAG and endogenous opioids (again referring to my own history, when I broke my arm, I was in an acute fight or flight response at the time so I felt no pain. I was until the adrenaline wore off that I was in agony). Chronic stress and negative emotional states (eg anxiety) can increase the intensity of pain. This is due to the overlap of brain circuits (such as the ACC) and so the heightened activity may result in priming for pain perception (there is also a role of the amygdala in persistent pain)&nbsp;</p>","Case 1, Pain"

Digestion starts with lingual and gastric lipases, however, the majority of digestion occurs in the small intestine. In the small intestine, the release of bile from the bile duct emulsifies the fat goblets into smaller chunks which are called micelles which have a larger surface area (they also contain cholesterol). Pancreatic lipase is secreted in active form from the pancreas. Pro-colipase is activated by trypsin to colipase which allows lipase enzymes to target the lipids. Phospholipase A2 and cholesterol ester hydrolase are also released and hydrolyse the micelles. In turn, micelles are hydrolysed to produce fatty acids, cholesterol, monoglyceride and lysolecithin.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of absorption, the breakdown products are reabsorbed into the enterocytes however leave behind the bile salts (some fatty acids diffuse into enterocytes).

Pepsinogen is converted into an active form of pepsin due to the presence of HCL. The release of pepsinogen is due to ACh from the vagus nerve and also gastrin). Pepsin breaks down protein into amino acids and oligopeptides. Pancreatic proteases (including trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen) become trypsin and chymotrypsin and enzymes on the brush border (such as enterokinase) break down the oligopeptides into amino acids, tripeptides and dipeptides.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The absorption of the breakdown products of a protein involves a sodium cotransporter (similar to carbohydrate uptake). Di and tripeptides are absorbed via a hydrogen ion cotransporter. Consequently, the di and tripeptides are hydrolysed to amino acids. Ultimately, the amino acids within the cells are then transported into the blood via facilitated diffusion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two important considerations for lipid digestion is pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis. Pancreatitis can involve the blockage of the ducts or damage to acinar cells causing ascites and leads to premature activation of the enzymes resulting in an autodigestion of the pancreas. If chronic, this can lead to the destruction of the acini and lead to steatorrhoea (due to lipids not being released).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cystic fibrosis patients lack the CFTR protein required for the bicarbonate secretion in the pancreas.

These hormones are important for a range of functions and also in growth and bone development.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The hormone oestrogen is also important as it plays an important role in the growth and maturation of bone as well as in the regulation of bone turnover in adult bone. During bone growth oestrogen is needed for proper closure of epiphyseal growth plates both in females and in males. With this in mind, a female who is post-menopausal with not have as high levels of oestrogen. Also, the gonads can be stimulated in females by FSH to produce oestrogen (FSH stimulates granulosa cells to produce oestrogen and inhibin and also develop the follicle. Lh stimulates the theca cells to release androgens which can then be converted to oestrogen. Oestrogen has negative feedback on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland. Inhibin selectively inhibits the release of FSH from the anterior pituitary gland). If the gonads are underdeveloped, then an individual may have lower levels of oestrogen.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Risk factors for osteoporosis include the following: female, over 50, no children, post or early menopause, Caucasian/ Asian, sedentary lifestyle, slim, alcohol, smoking, thyroid, hypogonadism, certain drugs (eg proton pump inhibitors).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Osteoporosis can be diagnosed through the scanning of bone density (DEXA) and involves measurement of the spine and hip.

In turn, fluid exudation, exudation of plasma proteins and migration of white blood cells occur. Inflammation can be caused by the release of chemical factors from plasma proteins or cells (such as the release of substances from damaged cells) or in response to a stimulus initiating inflammation (such as the detection of a pathogen). Some substances released which initiate an inflammatory response include TNF alpha and histamine.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The termination of an inflammatory response involves the removal of the offending agent and the mediators causing the inflammation to be broken down (there are essentially anti-inflammatory mechanisms).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, vascular changes occur. This involves transient vasoconstriction (I would guess this occurs for the purpose of directing blood to the area in which inflammation has been initiated. The logic behind this is that in the lungs, vasoconstriction of vessels can occur in order to direct the flow of blood to the areas of the lungs which are ventilated). Following the transient vasoconstriction, vasodilation occurs in response to histamine and nitric oxide. The dilation of the vessels follows a stasis and concentration of RBCs (which is why inflammation looks red, it's caused by the collecting of blood) and a neutrophil margination (the neutrophils travel into the tissue).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Leukocytes extravasation occurs and they begin phagocytosis. In the lumen of blood vessels, there is a margination, rolling and adhesion of the white blood cells, followed by transmigration across the endothelium and migration towards the chemotactic stimulus (a release of chemokine (an endogenous chemoattractant) such as CXCL8 can direct the neutrophils bacterial products).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, leukocytes can become activated in different ways. This can involve the presence of microbes (a pathogen), the products of necrotic cells (DAMPs are significant here), antigen-antibody complexes (this is more the adaptive immune response), the production of substances (arachidonic acid metabolites for example prostaglandins which also feature in inflammation, particularly through sensitizing nociceptors which results in pain), degranulation and secretion of lysosomal enzymes (which breaks down the pathogen), cytokine secretion and modulation of leukocytes adhesion molecules (significant for the travelling of the leukocytes from the blood vessels into the tissues).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the termination of the acute inflammatory response include the fact that the mediators of inflammation are short lived with a short half-life, are produced in quick bursts whilst the stimulus lasts and there are stop signals which can be generated which (ironically) stop the acute immune response.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Inflammation is necessary for damaged tissues, since the debris must be remoed first before tissue repair can occur. Some morphological patterns of acute inflammation include serous (fluid related, blood is significant), fibrinous (the tissue repair), ulcers (gastric ulcers can develop due to h.pyloiri) and suppurative or purulent (the exudate).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>http://static.wixstatic.com/media/c9ee27_8eb24d57b52ffd4b52264a79bd49ac93.jpg_512</p>","Case 1, Inflammation"

The elongation factor 1 alpha is important for the delivery of the tRNA to the sites in addition to GTP). A peptide bond is formed between the amino acids due to the activity of the enzyme peptidyl transferase.

RNA polymerase worked from the 5 ends to the 3 ends, aligning and producing a complementary mRNA strand. Transcription begins when the sigma factor is released and an enhancer boosts the transcription of nearby genes. Also, a cap is added (methylated guanine at 5 ends) and a tail (poly A at 3 ends) is put on the mRNA. The capping protects the DNA from degradation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These processes are both important for gene expression. Methods of controlling gene expression include controlling the regulatory proteins, control the nucleosome complex of histone and DNA and also the splicing together of different exons (introns are removed. This can result in the formation of different proteins from the same gene).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","DNA, Protein Synthesis, Cell biology"

The main function of ligaments is to add stability to the skeleton and its joints. Tendons have additional functions. For example, they allow muscle bellies to be located away from the site of action, reducing bulk in areas that need to be dextrous such as the hand. They can pass through narrow spaces because they are long and thin and they are quite avascular which helps this function as it reduces the risk of compression. They can act like ligaments to reinforce joint capsules (an example is the rotator cuff) and in some places (for example the interphalangeal joints) they can completely replace the joint capsule. Tendons increase the efficiency of movement by eliminating unnecessary muscle length and some tendons have an elastic tendency so can act like springs to increase force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hannah Shaw put a lecture on this on learning central.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is in the learning outcomes from the Case 1 lecture 'The importance of musculoskeletal health'.</p>","Tissues, Case 1"

It commonly affects weight bearing joints such as the knees and the reduction in joint space is usually uneven. On an X-ray, subchondral sclerosis may be seen which is whitening around the joint as bone density increases. There may also be osteophytes which are extra bits of abnormal bone formation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was covered in the learning outcomes from the case 1 lecture 'Osteoporosis and bones / Musculoskeletal health in Wales'.</p>","Bones, Cartilage, Case 1, Joints"

Progesterone also causes lactic duct dilation (prevents lactation, however).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When fertilization does not occur, the LH and FSH levels decrease (after 10-12 days) and the corpus luteum begins to degenerate, resulting in lower levels of oestrogen and progesterone.

It's also thought that HCG could be the cause of morning sickness during pregnancy). HCG maintains the corpus luteum, hence there is continued production of progesterone. After 8 weeks, the placenta produces progesterone. Fertilization also takes place in the ampulla of the uterine tubes in 24 hours after ovulation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Parturition (giving birth) results in an increase in both oestrogen and progesterone levels. This increases the excitability of the uterus. Prostaglandins also dilate the cervix and induce labour (prostaglandins cause smooth muscle contractions. They can also be used for inducing abortion). Production of relaxin from the corpus luteum, breasts and placenta softens the public ligaments and the pubic symphysis. Oxytocin causes positive feedback.

ATP binds to myosin head.</p>","<p>During muscle contraction, acetyl choline binds to inotropic receptors on the motor end plate of the muscle and hence causes flooding in of sodium ions. Sodium ions depolarize the sarcolemma (the membrane of muscle) and the sarcolemma propagates an action potential. The action potential travels down the t-tubule membranes and causes a release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (opens calcium channels on the SR). Calcium diffuses into the sarcoplasm and binds to tropnonin. This results in a conformational change and results in tropomyosin (which binds the binding sites on the actin filaments) to be exposed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Exposure of these binding sites allows myosin to bind and form a cross bridge. Myosin rotates in the actin-binding site (this involves the use of stored energy from ATP and hence ADP is released whilst this occurs). Eventually, ATP binds to the myosin head and causes the cross bridge to break down. This process occurs again, allowing myosin to draw actin filaments in.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The process of this results in both the I band and H zone of the sarcomere (the functional and repeating unit of a myofibril). A band doesn't change. In the event that the actin and myosin are too far apart, then they are unable to form a cross bridge. If they are too close, then they are too overlapped and cannot form a cross bridge (as observed in a length-tension curve).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the heart, there is an activation of l channels which allows in a small amount of calcium due to the action potential (this is called trigger calcium). This calcium then travels to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in the release of calcium.

This phenomenon is caused by the aortic dissection creating a <strong>false lumen between the layers of the aortic wall.</strong> Blood flow within this false lumen <strong>interferes with blood flow the branches of the aorta</strong> and can even shear them off if they are small! Here the false lumen has progressed to interfering with blood flow into the leg, through the L common iliac vessel (which becomes L femoral). The drop in blood pressure as blood leaks into the false lumen causes him to fall unconscious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Infective pericarditis usually involves flu like symptoms with chest pain that gets worse when lying down (relieved when leaning forward) causes by friction between layers of inflamed pericardium.

Damage to the bronchial wall (post infection, CF, smoking) leads to bacteria being able to adhere to the epithelium and colonise the lung. The presence of bacteria initiates an inflammatory response with draws neutrophils and monocytes to the site of infection. However, due to damage to the mucociliary escalator, the bronchi are unable to budge the mucous containing the the bacteria and the inflammatory response is unable to clear the infection and instead damages the lungs. This propogates a cycle of chronic inflammation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In bronchiectasis the lung tries to repair itself and lays down fibers, leading to irreversible damage - thickening and dilation of the bronchi. Migration and proliferation of epithelial cells during which time they synthesize fibronectin and integrin, which as well as promoting healing act as adherence site for the bacteria, propagating the infection</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The prognosis for bronchiectasis varies widely.

Activation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus can be achieved through either detection of falling blood pressure, the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline and also signals from the macula densa (present in the distal convoluted tubule and these are chemoreceptors detecting levels of sodium chloride.

Angiotensin 2 aims to increase blood pressure to its original or normal pressure. This can be achieved through blood vessel constriction (vasoconstriction), increasing the release of ADH (more water is absorbed from the collecting ducts and hence there is more water in the blood), increasing thirst (so the person consumes more fluids) and releasing aldosterone from the adrenal cortex of the adrenal gland. Aldosterone results in an increase in blood levels of sodium ions in the blood. This is achieved through increasing the sodium channels on p cells and more sodium-potassium channels in the DCT cells. As there are more ions taken up into the blood, water remains and travels into the blood due to an osmotic gradient.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Increasing levels of water in the blood increases blood pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>http://prohealthinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone_system-1024x571.png&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sympathetic stimulation results in vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles which decreases renal blood flow whereas parasympathetic stimulation may cause vasodilation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The efferent arteriole results in the capillaries of the cortex (peritubular capillaries).

A response to this is vasodilation which increases blood flow to the myocardial muscle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which of the following is not a trigger for the vasodilation of coronary arteries?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>Increased carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions</p>","<p>Increased local adenosine release</p>","<p>Increased potassium ions</p>","<p>Increased troponin</p>","<p>Tissue hypoxia</p>","<p>Angina occurs as a result of tissue ischaemia and thus there is an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.

Potassium then floods into the cells resulting in hyperpolarization and this restricts the entry of calcium ions into the vascular smooth muscles cells (due to the electrochemical gradient) and a relaxation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. The increased release of adenosine activate the <span style=""background-color: rgba(250, 0, 30, 0.15);"">potassium ATP</span> channels (see above answer) and this potentiates the release of NO (NO acts upon guanyl cyclase which in turn produces cGMP which activates protein kinase G which prevents the entry of calcium into the cell).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Increased levels of carbon dioxide result in increased hydrogen ions levels (since carbon dioxide reacts with water in the blood, producing the weak acid carbonic acid which releases hydrogen ions). These hydrogen ions blow calcium ion channels and hence preventing the entry of calcium into the cell.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Increased potassium levels within the cell (caused by the opening of the potassium katp channels) results in depolarisation which opens voltage-gated potassium rectifier channels. This results in vascular smooth muscle cells to become hyperpolarised and this reduces calcium ion entry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, the opening of potassium ATP channels, the entry of potassium ions and the blockage of calcium ion channels result in a relaxation of the blood vessels, allowing increased blood flow to the myocardial muscle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from local metabolic activity, coronary flow is also regulated through neural activity (mainly the SNS).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The window for coronary blood flow decreases with an increased heart rate (as there is less time spent in diastole), an increased ventricular end-diastolic volume and a decreased aortic pressure (the aortic pressure is involved in pushing blood into the coronary artery).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Coronary insufficiency can also be caused by aortic stenosis. This involves the narrowing of the aortic valve which results in the left ventricle to have to work harder to eject blood past this obstruction (left ventricular hypertrophy can result).

Some environmental factors that can contribute include smoking, fibrogenic dust (eg asbestos, silica, metals), aerosolized organic antigens, travelling (which might cause someone to have exposure to TB or parasitic infections), drugs and thermoactinomycetes (which can come from hay and affects farmers often).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is of an unknown cause and involves the thickening of the interstitium, infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells (an inflammatory response) and later the laying down of collagen from fibroblasts.

Furthermore, chronic bronchitis involves the hypertrophy of submucosal glands, an increased number of goblet cells and a mucociliary dysfunction which leads to an overproduction of mucus and retention. Chronic bronchitis involves cough and sputum. The retention of mucus leads to airway blocking and retained mucus is likely to become infected. Also, there is a greater airway inflammation and bronchial wall thickening and narrowed air tubes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Emphysema is an abnormal and permanent dilation of the airspace distal to the terminal bronchioles with the destruction of their walls.

There is the risk of using anti-inflammatory drugs in patients at risk of lung infection. CF involves a single nucleotide polymorphism in a chloride anion which results in the production of thick mucus in the lungs. A thicker mucus can result in an impairment of the mucociliary escalator and impairment of pathogen clearance. Furthermore, there are elevated inflammatory cells infiltrating in the lungs of CF patients (higher levels of macrophages and neutrophils). Both reactive oxygen species and protease enzymes can damage lung tissue and the host tissue has anti-oxidants against ros and anti-proteases (a deficiency of alpha-1 antiproteases can lead to the development of emphysema). During chronic disease, these protective molecules become depleted or overwhelmed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Neutrophils are capable of killing pathogens through phagocytosing them and then producing reactive oxygen species that target the bacterial lipids and proteins or through the protease enzymes and MMPs that target the proteins of bacteria.

As we age, this leads to the walls of arteries to become less elastic and rigid (which is why smoking is considered to cause premature ageing. Smoking can result in the break down of the elasticity of the lungs) which results in cardiac intropy having to increase in order to compensate. This can lead to a greater force on the ventricle, resulting in hypertrophy and increased myocardial oxygen demand.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Atherosclerosis involves the growth of LDL cholesterol plaques in the sub-endothelium, leading to an impairment of blood flow and reduced oxygenation of tissues.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Myocardial ischemia refers to the oxygen demand being unable to meet the myocardial demand.

Once ovulation occurs, your body secretes progesterone, which matures the endometrium and makes it the ideal hospitable environment for the fertilized egg to implant.

Instead of paying thousands of pounds, the Dad finds a groupon deal in a less-than-reputable clinic hoping to drum up some business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The clinic prides themselves on doing the least amount of work; an ovum is extracted by an experienced medical professional, and is placed in a cup of sperm. The trainee lab technician swirls the cup to ensure complete mixing, extracts the clean cell 10 minutes later, and delivers the cell proudly to the obstetrician for immediate implantation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This treatment does not work, however the groupon deal was buy-one-get-ten-free, and so the couple repeat the process. None of the attempts work (in this completely unrealistic scenario).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What&rsquo;s the likely explanation?</p>","<p>1. The genotype of the cell was trisomy 18 which is inviable</p>","<p>2. The sperm were malformed meaning they were unable to undergo the cortical reaction</p>","<p>3.

The cell was never fertilised to start off with, so it was never going to be viable to form an embryo</p><p><br />4. Correct!

There is some variation in exactly when hCG can be detected, but implantation occurs around day 6 days after fertilisation (so if presume fertilisation occurred on day 14, around day 20) and hCG can be detected in blood a couple of days after that and in urine about 2 weeks after.

If relying on menstrual cycle as contraception can have unprotected sex days 1-7 and 17-28. Therefore B and E are incorrect.&nbsp;</p><p>C = ectopic pregnancy will still give a positive result on a pregnancy test as hCG is still released once the embryo has implanted, although hCG levels do tend to be lower and rise more slowly than a regular pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><p>D = LH would be high on day 14 but this is not the reason for the false negative.

I/V goes where blood is and is good for looking at organs, for ischaemia and inflammation. Oral is good at outlining hollow organs.

Acetyl CoA would normally be shunted through the Krebs cycle, but starvation interferes with this. Firstly, the Krebs cycle cannot cope with the volume of Acetyl CoA being produced. Secondly, some of the important components of Krebs cycle, such as oxaloacetate, are being used up in gluconeogenesis. Thus, acetyl CoA is instead converted to ketone bodies in the liver and released into the bloodstream for uptake by the brain and heart.</p><p>Substance C- Glucose concentrations decline throughout starvation as glycogen stores in the liver are depleted. Ketone body use becomes more prevalent e.g. the brain uses 70% glucose and 30% ketone bodies by day 2 of starvation, and 30% glucose and 70% ketone bodies by day 7 of starvation. However, gluconeogenesis continues using glycerol from the breakdown of triglycerides, so glucose levels never drop below that of the fatty acids.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","case 10, Diabetes"

Alters pacemaker potential (phase 4) and plateau (phase 2). Treats SVT, AF (if brought on by increased SNS activity) and after MI. Decreases SNS activity by blocking B-adrenoreceptors.

Calcium L-type channel blockers in AVN diffuse across membrane and bind to cytosolic alpha-1 portion of Ca2+ channel, causing confirmational changes- causes channel to become inactive. Negative ionotrope/ dromotrope (slows AVN conduction) so increases time for each beat and decreases myocardium O2 requirements.

There is axonal damage to the nerve meaning there is no conduction (no sensory or motor function) when the injury occurs, however the endoneurium remains intact so a full recovery is possible. Tinnel's sign is present (pins and needles sensation over the nerve when it is lightly tapped, due to axonal damage) meaning it's not first degree as this sign is not present in first degree nerve injury and also there would still be some conduction to the finger after injury in first degree, but slowed (myelin damage only, not axonal). Also first degree recovery would also be quicker, usually around 12 weeks. Reasons it's not third degree is because there is only a varying degree of recovery usually in 3rd degree nerve injuries as some endoneurium may be scarred, so likely a full recovery wouldn't be made without some form of surgical intervention. Eliminate 4th and 5th degree as full recovery wouldn't occur in these.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Degrees of nerve injury -&nbsp;</p><p>1st degree (neuropraxia) - localised conduction block causing some demyelination so conduction slowed. Axon remains uninjured so no regeneration required, only remyelination, takes around 12 weeks to recover. No Tinnel's sign present.</p><p>2nd degree (axontmesis) - axonal injury so initial loss of conduction and Wallerian degeneration occurs. Proximal fibres regenerate at around 1 inch per month, but endoneurium remains intact so full recovery usually made (unless there is a big gap between injury and motor end plate), but takes lot longer than first degree recovery. Tinnel's sign present.</p><p>3rd degree (scarring) - Scarring within endoneurium as well as axonal damage so varying degree of recovery depending on amount of scarring and if the nerve fibre damaged is sensory, motor or mixed. Not usually a full recovery unless internal neurolysis done which can help recovery. Tinnel's sign present.</p><p>4th degree (complete scar block) - nerve is still complete but there is complete scar block so loss of endoneurial, axonal and perineurial conductivity. No functional regeneration will occur across scar block unless scar is removed (done by surgeon). Tinnel's sign present.</p><p>5th degree (neurotmesis) - nerve is completely severed so must be rejoined for regeneration to occur. Won't make a full recovery. Tinnel's sign present.</p><p>6th degree (mixed) - combination of above degrees i.e. injury varies between fascicles, so some may recover and some may not (depending on injury).

Activation of angiotensin 1 receptors causes vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion, to raise systemic blood pressure. Activation of angiotensin 2 receptors causes vasodilation and NO secretion. However, there are more type 1 receptors so the overall effect of angiotensin II is vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion.

The most important prostaglandins in the kidney are PGE2 and PGI2 which cause vasodilation to increase GFR.

However, in young, healthy people this compensatory mechanism is less vital as the other systemic and local compensatory mechanisms are fully functioning.&nbsp;</p><p>D = macula dense cells release adenosine in response to slightly raised GFR.

Type of circulatory shock, decreased tissue perfusion can cause cell death. Basically irreversible, can cause cardiac arrest. Sustained hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion. MI is a common cause. Can be caused by a cardiomyopathy, valve problems/ arrhythmia. Increased heart rate as heart tries to beat more to make up for decreased SV, vascular resistance increases as blood vessels vasoconstrict to increase BP and preload, decreased EF as heart cannot beat efficiently, PCWP and increased EDV as blood backs up as cannot be pumped. And skin is cold as blood is shunted to vital organs.</p><p>B- INCORRECT, aka haemorrhagic shock. Loss of 1/5 of blood due to haemorrhage/ dehydration. Can also be due to loss of plasma because burns/ severe vasodilation. Causes tachycardia, hypotension and decreased perfusion (cyanosis). Feel dizzy, faint and sick. Symptoms include hypotension and decreased CO as decreased SV and increased EF because less blood to pump, heart works hard to pump as much as it can.</p><p>C- INCORRECT, caused by obstruction of great vessels/ heart e.g. PE/ cardiac tamponade. Similar to cardiogenic shock.</p><p>D- INCORRECT, aka disruptive shock. Problem with regulation of whether blood goes to vital/ non-vital organs. Caused by infection. Cytokines released cause dysregulation of vasoconstriction and blood flow to vital organs vs non-vital organs- so blood that would be directed to the heart/ brain isn't. Vasodilation and shunting of blood to non-essential organs. Increased HR and CO. Decreased EF due to infection. Raised JVP.</p><p>E- INCORRECT,&nbsp;a combination of areflexia/hyporeflexia and autonomic dysfunction that accompanies spinal cord injury. The initial hyporeflexia presents as a loss of both cutaneous and deep tendon reflexes below the level of injury accompanied by loss of sympathetic outflow, resulting in hypotension and bradycardia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can also have neurogenic shock;&nbsp;a distributive type of shock resulting in low blood pressure, occasionally with a slowed heart rate, that is attributed to the disruption of the autonomic pathways within the spinal cord.

In principle cells of the collecting ducts. Influenced by aldosterone. Na+ moves into principle cell and K+ moves out on apical membrane. On basolateral membrane, Na+/K+ pump works to move Na+ out and K+ into principle cell. Cl- moves in paracellularly. Regulated by JGA; macula densa cells detect low Na+ and so low flow rate due to low BP and cause renin release, triggering the RAAS. Aldosterone increases the number of Na+ channels on the apical membrane of principle cells and Na+/K+ antiporter in basolateral membrane, promoting Na+ reabsorption.&nbsp;</p><p>B- INCORRECT, reabsorbs some Na+. Transported against electrochemical gradient by Na+/Cl- transporters. Then Na+ leaves DCT cell basolaterally via Na+/K+ pump and Cl- via Cl- uniporter. A problem with this transporter would cause Gitelman's syndrome (autosomal recessive, low BP, salt wasting, hypokalaemic). Principle cells in DCT and collecting ducts.</p><p>C- CORRECT, 65% Na+ reabsorbed here. Na+/K+ ATPase pump on basolateral surface of PCT cells that provides driving tone for reabsorption. Reabsorption is stimulated by AII and aldosterone and inhibited by ANP. SGLT2: Na+ moves down electrochemical gradient into PCT cell with glucose (symporter; secondary active transport for glucose- then leaves into blood via GLUT-2 (uniporter). SGLT2 and GLUT2 change into SGLT1 and GLUT1 further down the PCT as there's less glucose so higher affinity transporters required. Water follows by osmosis.</p><p>D- INCORRECT, 25% reabsorption occurs in thick ascending limb. Na+/K+/2Cl- symporter and Na+/H+ antiporter.

In this form, the affected person fears they are being stalked, spied upon, obstructed, poisoned, conspired against or harassed by other individuals or an organisation. As a result, the sufferer may retaliate violently against the persecution and/or turn to the law and other government agencies for support.</li></ul><ul><li>Delusion of grandeur In this form of delusion, the person believes they are much greater or more influential than they really are. For example, they may be convinced they have an exceptional talent, extravagant riches or a special relationship with a prominent person.</li></ul><ul><li>Delusional jealousy This usually develops due to a fear that a spouse or partner is being unfaithful. These doubts may be unfounded and can cause severe damage to the relationship. The sufferer usually goes to great lengths to try and find evidence of their partner&rsquo;s alleged &ldquo;affairs&rdquo; and may also resort to a third party such as a private detective to find such evidence. Studies have shown that this form of delusion is more common in men than in women. It is sometimes called morbid jealousy or pathological jealousy.</li></ul><ul><li>Erotomania or delusion of love In this form of delusion, the patient is often firmly convinced that a person he or she is fixated upon is in love with them. This obsession leads to stalking, unnatural jealousy and rage when the object of their affection is seen with their spouse or partners. Erotomanis often concern a famous person or someone who is in a superior status and usually there is no contact between the patient and the victim, who has never encouraged the patient.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>D therefore best describes Gerald's delusions&nbsp;</p>","Mental Health, Case 12, psychosis, Schizophrenia"

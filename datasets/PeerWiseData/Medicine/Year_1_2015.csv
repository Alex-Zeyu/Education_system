This wouldn&rsquo;t be the case for a skeletal muscle. Explain why.</p>","<p>There is not enough Ca2+ supply in the sacroplasmic reticulum of the heart, whereas there is enough in a skeletal muscle.</p>","<p>The skeletal muscle requires Ca2+ from the extracellular fluid to bind to Calmodulin, which is the only way to stimulate muscle contraction. In skeletal muscle there is no Calmodulin involved.</p>","<p>Ca2+ is required to bind with calcium-sodium exchanger in order for the action potential to reach and spread to the cardiac muscle. In skeletal muscle this is all induced by Acetylcholine.</p>","<p>The T-tubules in a cardiac muscle requires Ca++ presence to activate a cascade of enzyme reaction, mainly regulated by cAMP for the muscle to contract. In skeletal muscle, the Ca++ is not required.</p>","","<p>A heart placed in a&nbsp;calcium-free solution will quickly stop beating. The&nbsp;reason for this response is that the openings of the T&nbsp;tubules pass directly through the cardiac muscle cell&nbsp;membrane into the extracellular spaces surrounding&nbsp;the cells, allowing the same extracellular fluid that is&nbsp;in the cardiac muscle interstitium to percolate through&nbsp;the T tubules. Consequently, the quantity of calcium&nbsp;ions in the T tubule system (i.e., the availability of calcium&nbsp;ions to cause cardiac muscle contraction) depends to a&nbsp;great extent on the extracellular fluid calcium ion&nbsp;concentration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, the strength of skeletal muscle contraction&nbsp;is hardly affected by moderate changes in extracellular&nbsp;fluid calcium concentration because skeletal muscle&nbsp;contraction is caused almost entirely by calcium ions&nbsp;released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum inside the skeletal&nbsp;muscle fiber.</p>","Physiology, Action Potentials, The Heart, PCS unit 2, PCS unit 2 Heart"

This may result in arterial wall damage, thus leading to vessel irregularity, aneurysm formation or thrombosis. Aneurysm can cause compression of the sensory branch of the ulnar nerve.1</p><p>HHS is usually found in men of working age with occupations that involve repetitive blunt trauma to the hands, this has also been observed in athletes with sports-related injuries. Patients may present with a tender mass in the hypothenar eminence, pain in the palm, numbness in the fourth and fifth fingers, and ischaemia of the fourth and fifth fingers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although the diagnosis can be confirmed easily with sonography, by showing ulnar artery thrombosis or aneurysm, MRI and MR angiography (MRA) provide a comprehensive evaluation of the hypothenar region. MRI can be used to evaluate osteochondral, neural, vascular, tendinous and ligamentous structures. MRA can be useful in detecting early changes of arterial wall thickening, irregularity and aneurysms. MRA is also useful in demonstrating the site of segmental occlusion of the ulnar artery.2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Patients with HHS are advised rest from the offending activity, smoking cessation and therapy with vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers. The thrombosed segments are usually treated with surgical excision and reconstruction with a vein graft.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The differential diagnosis for HHS includes benign tumours of the hand including lipomas, schwannomas, vascular malformations and ganglion cysts, which can mimic ulnar artery aneurysms. Thromboangiitis Obliterans (Buerger&rsquo;s disease) can present as an irregularity; it has a corkscrew appearance on MRA of the hand, and can mimic HHS. However, involvement of digital arteries in the former while involvement around the wrist joint in HHS will help in differentiating these two entities. Thus, in appropriate clinical settings, MR and MRA can conclusively diagnose HHS by depicting aneurysm formation and the pathognomonic &lsquo;corkscrew&rsquo; appearance.3</p>","Anatomy, Upper limb, Clinical Significance"

Heart failure can be caused by:</p><p>Impairment of myocardial contractility, loss of healthy muscle can occur if the cardiac muscles experiences hypoxia or ischaemia due to a loss of normal blood supply. The loss of health cardiac muscle mass is known as myocardial infarction. This leads to a decrease in the cardiac performance. Impairment of the filling or emptying of the heart. In atrial fibrillation the ventricles will not be completely filled at the onset of atrial systole so the cardiac output will fall. The narrow valve opening in mitral stenosis will lead to incomplete filling of the ventricles meaning the CO will fall. Extracardiac factors: An increased preload can be caused by renal failure so that the blood plasma increases by a lot. This will lead to an increase in the volume of blood entering the ventricles this due to the frank starling mechanism will mean that the sarcomere contractile efficiency will decrease leading to heart failure. Afterload is the pressure in the aorta which the heart must overcome in order to pump the blood from the left ventricle into the aorta. The afterload is determined by vascular tone and is increased when the arterial blood pressure rises. Whenever afterload is increased the work of the heart also increases in order to cope. This can lead to heart failure where the heart cannot supply the body with oxygen.</p>","The Heart, PCS unit 2, Clinical Significance, PCS unit 2 Heart"

Under high shear stress, such as is found in the microcirculation, the interaction between subendothelial von Willebrand factor (VWF) and its platelet receptor, glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V, is required to slow down platelets and allow the platelet collagen receptors aloha2beta1 and GP VI to bind to collagen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>GP VI and alpha2beta1 play important roles to activate platelets in the early stage and work with GP Ib-IX-V to fully activate platelets to form thrombi. GP Ib-IX-V and GP VI employ similar signaling pathways for platelet activation and the signals from both receptors are down-modulated by PECAM-1 (platelet-endothelial-cell adhesion molecule 1) to prevent unnecessary platelet activation under high shear. During inflammatory states, intact endothelial cells release VWF and P-selectin from their Weibel-Palade bodies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Both molecules are ligands for GP Ib-IX-V. The newly released VWF is larger and stickier than the form normally found in plasma and binds platelets spontaneously. Normally, VWF is processed by proteolysis by the plasma metalloprotease ADAMTS-13. Failure of this processing results in the microvascular thrombotic disorder thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. In this review, the authors also use available crystal structures of platelet receptors and ligands to explain the details of their interactions.<br /><br /></p>","Microanatomy, PCS Unit 3, PCS unit 2"

She has recently been brought to A&amp;E after suffering a fall and fracturing her femur. After a moderately long stay in hospital, Mrs Jones has recovered from her injury and is ready to be discharged and is looking forward to returning home. Her son, however, insists she cannot go back to living alone, since he believes she is incapable of living independently. He is very worried that his mother may fall and injure herself again. He also says she has become forgetful recently, and he believes she may have developed dementia.</p><p>Mrs Jones' cognitive abilities are assessed via MoCA, and she scores 26/30. She insists she wants to go home, even though she is alone and her family live far away. Her son is adamant she is not capable of making this decision, and points out that it would be unwise for her to go home and risk hurting herself again, since she would have no one around to help her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If the doctors were to listen to Mrs Jones' son, and deem her incapable of making a decision, why would this be a violation of the Mental Capacity Act (2005)?</p>","<p>2nd Principle: Individuals being supported to make their own decisions.</p>","<p>3rd Principle: Unwise decisions.</p>","<p>5th Principle: Less restrictive option.</p>","<p>No sign of impairment or disturbance to cognitive function - therefore no need for capacity assessment.</p>","<p>Mrs Jones has not named her son as LPA (Lasting Power of Attorney).</p>","<p>The Mental Capacity Act is based around 5 core principles:</p><p>1) Presumption of Capacity - an individual is to be presumed to have capacity unless it is established otherwise;</p><p>2) Individuals being supported to make their own decisions - every step must be taken in order for the individual to understand the circumstances and be able to make the decision (e.g. hearing aid if hearing impairment is present, interpreter if English not first language, etc.)</p><p>3) Unwise Decisions - an indivisual is not to be considered incapable simply due to the fact that they make a decision which we judge to be unwise.</p><p>4) Best interests - if a decision is made as a consequence of someone being deemed incapable of making their own decision, it must be made in that person's best interests.</p><p>5) Less restrictive option - before a decision is made, it must be judged whether or not this decision can be carried out in a way which would interfere less with the person's basic rights and freedoms of action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may be tempted to answer C - and you are right: it would be wrong to consider Mrs Jones incapable of deciding for herself simply because she is making a decision which seems unwise.</p><p>However: her cognitive ability has been tested via the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and she has scored 26. The MoCA scoring guidelines (http://www.bmc.org/Documents/Montreal-cognitive-assessment-MoCA.pdf) consider a score of 26 or higher as normal. Therefore, Mrs Jones has no cognitive impairment, and her capacity to make decisions cannot be disputed by the Mental Capacity Act:</p><p>""a person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if at<br />the material time he is unable to make a decision for himself in relation to the<br />matter <strong>because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the</strong><br /><strong>mind or brain</strong>.""</p><p>Since she has no impairment or disturbance, by definition, she cannot lack capacity. It is possible that the forgetfulness her son has noticed is simply due to normal ageing, rather than a pathological condition.</p><p>Option E would only become relevant in the scenario in which Mrs Jones had been deemed incapable, and a person would have to make a decision in her stead.</p>","Case 6, Dementia, Mental Capacity, Cognitive Assessment"

The role of the class I MHC proteins is vital as they signal to cytotoxic T-cells that infectious microorganisms are hidden with the cells of the body. The class I protein is made within the cell and then binds to an 8&ndash;9 amino acid peptide produced by the cell which is either &lsquo;self&rsquo; or &lsquo;foreign&rsquo;.

After talking to her further, you uncover that she has irritable bowel syndrome and is on warfarin.

As she is over 55, this puts her at a higher risk of cancer or other GI complications. (being over 55 was one of the criteria for endoscopy mentioned in the lecture on dyspepsia).</p><p>C - This might end up being the treatment however it isn't the first thing you would do without investigation.</p><p>D - it is possible her diarrhoea is only due to IBS, however as she presents with symptoms from the upper GI tract such as a heartburn and abdominal tenderness, it is definitely worth investigating this.</p><p>E - Again, this would be fine however she already has diarrhoea and magnesium oxide has a side effect of osmotic diarrhoea.

Prostaglandins normally cause vaso<strong>dilation</strong> of the afferent arteriole (not vaso<strong>constriction</strong>). Therefore inhibition of this would cause vaso<strong>constriction</strong> of the afferent arteriole (not vaso<strong>dilation)</strong>, causing decreased renal perfusion pressure. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>More info on why constriction causes decreased renal perfusion pressure (copied from wiki):</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Normally the afferent arteriole is of larger diameter than the efferent. This means there is high resistance as the blood is forced from a wider vessel to a narrower one and this promotes filtration. If the arterial blood pressure remains constant then contracting either vessel reduces blood flow as it increases resistance. However contracting either has opposite effects on the filtration pressure. If you contract the afferent arteriole there will be less of a pressure difference between the afferent and efferent arteriole so there will be reduced filtration pressure. However if you constrict the efferent arteriole you are increasing the pressure difference between the two and filtration pressure increase.</p><p>Overall the constriction of the afferent arteriole decreases both blood flow and filtration pressure where as constricting the efferent arteriole decreases blood flow but increases filtration pressure. (Both of these statements are assuming a constant blood pressure). The fact that both can be altered allows independent regulation of both GFR and blood flow.</p>","Case 1, PCS Unit 3, Pharmacology, Kidney"

Between the inner and outer membrane is the cell wall, similar to that of Gram + bacteria, just usually thinner. The synthesis of the cell wall is the major target of antibiotics. The main group of antibiotics in this class are the beta lactam antibiotics, they all have a similar structure the beta lactam ring. These antibiotics, to which the penicillins and cephalosporins belong, act by inhibiting a protein called penicillin binding protein (PBP), which causes cross linking of the peptidoglycan in the cell wall.

A prolonged exposure to alcohol down regulates the GABAa receptors and so when alcohol is removed there aren't enough GABAa receptors to balance out the large number of NMDA receptors.

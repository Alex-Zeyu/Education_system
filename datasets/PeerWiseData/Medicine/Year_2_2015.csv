Different types of seizure have been reported in this syndrome.

The fact that very large pressure changes are required during the establishment of breathing mewns that lung compliance is very low compared with that of the adult (C). Although the proportion of the right ventricular output passing through the lungs greatly increases after the first breath, it takes a few days for the ductus arteriosus to shut completely, therefore some shunting still happens (D).

Next there is fusion of the cell membranes via interns on the surface of the oocyte and their ligands on the sperm.

This is why this patient was then put on an Angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARA) (e.g. losartan) which does not affect the levels of bradykinin.&nbsp;</p><p>However both, ACEI and ARA are contraindicated in bilateral renal stenosis.

Because BRS patients have a reduced flow because of the narrowing of the renal artery and therefore really need the action of Angiotensin II on the efferent arterioles to make sure the pressure is sufficient for the blood to pass inside the Bowman's capsule.

However, in BRS patients, it acts increasingly more on the efferent to keep some pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Isosorbide mononitrate decrease the preload by vasodilating the veins, and hydralazine decrease the afterload by vasodilating the afterload. These drugs are usually given in combinations and they improve the symptoms and mortality rates of HR patients.&nbsp;</p>","Pharmacology, Cardiology, Case 15, Kidneys"

It all starts with chronic cell injury, which increases the permeability of of blood vessels to LDLs. LDLs collect in the intima where they become oxidised to oxLDL. oxLDL express inflammatory adhesion molecules which promote monocyte and platelet adhesion to endothelial surface. Next step (formation of fatty streaks) involves the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages in intima. The macrophages takes up oxLDL to become foam cells. Foam cells and activated platelets release PDGF. In development of the lipid plaque, PDGF stimulates smooth muscle cell proliferation and a chronic inflammatory response takes place. Dying foam cells release lipids, contributing to extracellular free lipid pools. In the final stage (advanced plaques), a plaque forms consisting of a lipid rich core and fibrous cap. Increased smooth muscle cell proliferation leads to an increased synthesis of collagen, leading to hardening of the atherosclerotic plaque&nbsp;</p>","Cardiology, Case 4, Immunology"

As IgM is made up of 5 &nbsp;immunoglobulins joined together by a joining (J) chain, and each immunoglobulin has 2 antigen-binding sites, we can say that the valency is 5x2=10.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2LRJe2Q4h7w/UKznngNiCNI/AAAAAAAAB9g/vcv95LFPPAs/s1600/IgM.jpg"" alt="""" width=""350"" height=""336"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Case 9, Immunology"

The level of consciousness may decrease and also give rise to flaccid paralysis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A. <strong>Subfalcine herniation:</strong>&nbsp;this occurs when the cingualate gyrus is displaced under the falx and to the opposite side. It can result in the compression of the anterior cerebral artery.</p><p>B.&nbsp;<strong>Transtentorial (Uncal) herniation:&nbsp;</strong>this occurs when the uncinate process of the temporal lobe herniates into the anterior part of the opening of the tentorium cerebelli.</p><p>D.&nbsp;<strong>Central tentorial herniation:&nbsp;</strong>this occurs when there is symmetrical downward movement of the thalamic region through the opening of tentorium cerebelli.</p><p>E. <strong>Transcalvarial herniation:&nbsp;</strong>aka external herniation, this occurs when there is downward displacement of the brain through a defect in the skull such as a fracture site or following a craniectomy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/brain-herniation/ has a good diagram of the herniations and simple explanations!</p>","Neurology, Case 16, Imaging"

In DKA, insulin deficiency and glucagon excess promote hyperglycemia and ketogenesis. Anion gap metabolic acidosis, volume depletion, and dehydration occur. Left untreated, the condition may progress to coma and death. High urine glucose in DKA induces osmotic diuresis and pulls K+ into the urine and out of the body. At the same time, the metabolic acidosis present in DKA pulls K+ from the intracellular space to the extracellular space. (Recall that the body adapts to high H+ levels in the serum by moving H+ into the cells in exchange for bringing K+ out of the cells.) The result is low intracellular K+, normal to high serum K+ (i.e. hyperkalemia), and low total body K+.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the polyuria and polydipsia, this patient's tachypnea and labored breathing are major clinical signs of DKA, as they indicate hyperventilation (respiratory alkalosis), an important compensatory mechanism. Increased respiration accelerates the expulsion of CO2 from the circulation, thus altering metabolic homeostasis such that circulating H+ and HCO3- are converted to carbonic acid and then into CO2 and H20 (both of which are exhaled) via carbonic anhydrase. The subsequent decrease in circulating H+ helps to buffer the acidemia of DKA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A and B -&nbsp;Phosphate and magnesium levels are more commonly decreased in DKA.</p><p>C -&nbsp;The hallmark of DKA is profound hyperglycemia.</p><p>E -&nbsp;DKA presents with metabolic acidosis and acidemia (pH &lt; 7.35) not alkalemia (pH &gt;7.45).</p>","Case10, Diabetes"

During this conversion, one molecule each of NADH and FADH2 is formed, both of which enter the electron transport chain to form ATP (2 from FADH2 and 3 from NADH). Therefore, we can say that 5 molecules of ATP are generated in beta-oxidation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the liver mitochondria, acetyl-CoA has 2 pathways it can go into:</p><p><strong>1) Under normal conditions,&nbsp;</strong>the acetyl-CoA would enter the Krebs cycle to get more ATP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2)&nbsp;</strong>However, <strong>in states of starvation</strong>, it does no enter the Krebs cycle, as it must condense with oxaloacetate to make citrate. However, there is no oxaloacetate in the liver mitochondria when starving. This is because in starvation, oxaloacetate exits the mitochondria, goes into the cytoplasm and enters the gluconeogenesis pathway instead. Therefore, acetyl-CoA accumulates because it can't enter the Krebs cycle, and there it is all channeled into ketone body formation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The acetyl-CoA, still in the mitochondrial matrix of the liver, is converted to HMG-CoA by HMG-CoA synthase, which is then converted to <strong>acetoacetate</strong>&nbsp;(1/3), under the action of HMG-CoA lyase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Acetoacetate is inherently unstable, therefore the body puts an electron from NAD onto it to form <strong>B-hydroxybutyrate&nbsp;</strong>(2/3)&nbsp;(aka 3-hydroxybutyrate).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What can also happen to the unstable acetoacetate, a carboxyl group can be removed from the molecule, therefore decarboxylating it, to form&nbsp;<strong>acetone</strong> (3/3).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the three ketone bodies that move from the hepatocytes to the blood are; acetoacetate, B-hydroxybutyrate and acetone (note that acetone cannot be used as a fuel, it is diagnostically used by its distinct pear-drop smell).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All of the acetoacetate and B-hydroxybutyrate enter the extrahepatic cells from the blood (mainly muscle, renal cortex and brain in prolonged fasting). The B-hydroxybutyrate is reconverted BACK to acetoacetate by removing an electron to form NADH.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The acetoacetate is then activated by an enzyme called&nbsp;<strong>Thiophorase&nbsp;</strong>(which is not found in the liver), to form acetoacetyl-CoA. This molecule is then cleaved in the mitochondria to form 2 molecules of acetyl CoA, which then condenses with oxaloacetate to form citrate&nbsp;&rarr; Krebs cycle&nbsp;&rarr; generates ATP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TLDR; ketones are made from fatty acids.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Case10, Biochemistry"

By the time this impulse in the slow pathway reaches the end of the AVN, the refractory period of the fast pathway is over, and so it can enter the fast pathway distally and the impulse can go round and round in an AVN reentry circuit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Cardiology, Case 13"

Think of blowing up a balloon, as you increase the radius the wall tension also increases, and eventually it bursts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore if the radius, wall tension and pressure increase, eventually this will lead to an aneurysm.</p><p>Because the aneurysm has a great radius, its wall tension will be greater than that of surrounding normal vessel segments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If the vessel enlarges, wall tension increases and the vessel is more likely to burst, leading to a dissecting aneurysm which is a medical emergency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are more common than their thoracic counterpart. One reason for this is that elastin, the principal load-bearing protein present in the wall of the aorta, is reduced in the abdominal aorta as compared to the thoracic aorta. Another is that the abdominal aorta does not possess vasa vasorum, the nutrient-supplying blood vessels within the wall of the aorta. Most AAA are true aneurysms that involve all three layers (tunica intima, tunica media and tunica adventitia). The prevalence of AAAs increases with age, with an average age of 65&ndash;70 at the time of diagnosis. AAAs have been attributed to atherosclerosis, though other factors are involved in their formation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before rupture, an AAA may present as a large, expansile mass above the umbilicus. A bruit may be heard from the turbulent flow in the aneurysm. Unfortunately, however, rupture may be the first hint of AAA. Once an aneurysm has ruptured, it presents with classic symptoms of abdominal pain which is severe, constant, and radiating to the back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Aortic_aneurysm.jpg"" alt="""" width=""402"" height=""411"" /></p>","Cardiology, Case 15"

When taking a history, the patient complains of feeling exhausted, although he blames this on not being able to sleep very well for the past few months. He also mentions that he has had type 2 diabetes for 10 years but emphasises that he is well controlled on metformin. He is not asthmatic.

NOT BISOPROLOL (BETA-BLOCKER) - Beta blockers are contraindicated in unstable heart failure and because of the patient's symptoms and oedema it is unstable.

Beta-blockers are involved in first-line treatment in stable heart failure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.

Furosemide may be given at a lower dose or even switched to a weaker diuretic such as spironolactone when the worst of the odemea is gone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All diuretics can mask hypoglycaemia and so should be used with caution in diabetics but loop diuretics, like furosemide, are not as bad as thiazide diuretics, like spironolactone, at this and so furosemide will be preferred Furosemide is contraindicated in patients in renal failure but this patient doesn't show signs of renal failure.

It antagonises the action of ACh by binding competitively with ACh receptors on the motor end-plate. This antagonism is inhibited, and neuromuscular block reversed, by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AchE inhibitors- prevent ACh breakdown increasing concentration in the cleft and so decreasing the competitive effect of Atracurium).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other neuromuscular blockers include suxamethonium which is a depolarising agent- this causes fasciculations when administered. It works by agonising the effects of ACh by binding to Ach receptors. However AChE cannot breakdown Suxamethonium as it can ACh therefore the motor end plate remains depolarised and so cannot be repolarised for continual firing. This state means that no more action potentials can be fired and so neuromuscular block. This is the MOA described in option A.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The diagram below shows the action at a normal motor end plate, making it easier to relate the actions of the two drugs described above:</p><p><img src=""https://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/103/flashcards/720103/jpg/motor_end_plate1322429575692.jpg"" alt="""" /></p>","PCS, Pharmacology, Anaesthetics, Biochemistry, Case 14"

Podraic comes to see you because since fighting off Stannis Baratheon's army, he has developed a phobia of swords, often has a low mood and is awoken in the night by recurrent nightmares of scenes from the battlefield. You diagnose Podraic with post traumatic stress disorder and prescribe a joint treatment plan of psychotherapy and Sertraline.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A few weeks go by and Podraic has greatly improved, he is much happier in himself and his nightmares have become much less frequent and severe. He is, however, slightly concerned as he is having some difficulty getting and maintaining an erection, as well as difficulty achieving orgasm. Despite your reassurances that these are common side-effects of Sertraline (and not indicative of a disease process), he is still worried because news of his legendary prowess in the bedroom has spread throughout the land, and he does not wish to disappoint any prospective northern suitors. He fears that if news of his erectile dysfunction gets out, not even a date to Castle Black's Kasturi could impress them. As he has responded so well to Sertraline, he is unwilling to switch to a different medication for fear of a relapse of his PTSD symptoms. You therefore decide that the most appropriate way to address his problem is:</p>","<p>Prescribe an intracavernosal injection of alprostadil, a prostaglandin E1 analogue</p>","<p>Recommend a condom whose lubricant is mixed with benzocaine on the penile surface.</p>","<p>Prescribe propranolol to control any physical manifestations of anxiety</p>","<p>Prescribe an oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, such as Sildenafil</p>","<p>Prescribe a PPAR-gamma agonist, as his erectile dysfunction is likely a consequence of untreated type II diabetes mellitus.</p>","<p>D is correct, the most appropriate option from the list above is a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor. Phosphodiesterase 5 breaks down cyclic GMP, which has a vasodilatory effect on the tissue of the corpora cavernosa, and so inhibiting this enzyme reduces the breakdown of cGMP and enables the corpora cavernosa to remain dilated for longer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A - While a PGE1 analogue is an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction, the route of administration is likely to be unpalatable and carries the small risk of infection associated with any injection.</p><p>B - This would exacerbate the problem of anorgasmia, or difficulty in reaching orgasm; in fact, such condoms are often marketed as aides to help with premature ejaculation.</p><p>C - This may be appropriate for symptoms of panic associated with PTSD however, as Podraic is well managed on sertraline alone this would not be necessary. Beta-blockers may also impair the ability of an individual to carry out intense physical activity, so Podraic may find his stamina in the bedroom reduced.</p><p>D - correct</p><p>E - As Podraic is young and physically fit, he is unlikely to have type 2 DM, and even if he did a PPAR-gamma activator is not first line treatment.</p>","Pharmacology, Depression, Psychiatry, Psychotherapies, Mental Health"

So you can see the head end is considerably longer than the tail end. And forming in the midline of the epiblast is a groove called the&nbsp;<strong>primitive streak</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In week 3, the cells of the epiblast, from the right and left side, migrate towards the midline, primitive streak. When they get to the midline, they turn and go inwards and descend towards the hypoblast beneath it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the cells of the epiblast migrate through the primitive streak and all the way down to where the hypoblast cells are, they invaginate that layer and start to occupy it. As more and more of epiblastic cells do this, they displace the hypoblast cells which eventually die. This layer of epiblast cells forms the&nbsp;<strong>endoderm</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other cells that migrate through the primitive streak migrate toward the hypoblast, but enter the space between the two layers, which forms the middle layer called the&nbsp;<strong>mesoderm.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other cells from the epiblast migrate through the primitive streak, also become part of the middle layer but these cells stay right in the midline and form the&nbsp;<strong>notochord</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, we have cells of the epiblast that don't migrate through the primitive streak, but remain in the upper layer (epiblast) and form the&nbsp;<strong>ectoderm</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the trilaminar embryonic disc is formed with an outer ectoderm, inner mesoderm and notochord and innermost endoderm - all originally from the epiblast cells.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Different parts of the ectoderm will adopt different names depending on which part of the upper layer they occupy, for example;</p><ul><li>Those that occupy the upper layer near the midline will form&nbsp;<strong>neural ectoderm cells</strong></li><li>Cells that are right alongside that are called the&nbsp;<strong>neural crest cells</strong></li><li>The remainder either become skin or surface ectodermal cells.</li></ul><p><img src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3458/3361739410_e78eb559b1_z.jpg?zz=1"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""307"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Neurulation</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During development, the notochord releases substances into its surrounding area to direct the cells around it to differentiate in different ways. One such substance is &nbsp;the Shh protein, which induces formation of the floor plate of the neural tube.</p><p>The notochord also induces ectodermal cells over it to form the neural plate. The lateral edges of the neural plate become more elevated and form a neural fold with a depressed midregion called the neural groove. The neural folds come together and fuse to form the neural tube, which later forms the brain and spinal cord.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note that neural tube defects are caused by arrest of normal development and closure of the neural tube, resulting in conditions such as spina bifida or anencephaly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>----</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So now that we have a flat 3 layered embryo, we need it to become 3D. Think of three papers all on top of each other, top paper is ectoderm, middle paper is mesoderm and the paper at the bottom is the endoderm. To make it a round 3 layered embryo, we need to fold it (4 weeks). Therefore, the edge on the left and right meet and fuse at the midline to form a tube. Once the tube is formed, the outer layer is ectoderm, middle layer is mesoderm and inner layer of endoderm, with the tube opened at front and back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, we know the inner endoderm forms the lining of the gut tube, so one open end is for the mouth and the other is for the anus. The outer layer is the ectoderm, which we know forms the surface of the body, skin. And everything in between is mesoderm, which gives rise to cartilage, bone, muscle, connective tissue, blood etc. Which is in fact what we find between the surface of the body and the lining of the gut tube.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""http://images.slideplayer.com/14/4343420/slides/slide_8.jpg"" alt="""" width=""589"" height=""442"" /></p><p>What happens when the lateral body folds fail to fuse properly? You end up with a gap in the ventral body wall. This can allow structures that should be inside the embryo to escape and end up in the amniotic cavity. One such problem is gastroschisis, where abdominal viscera exits through a defect in the abdominal wall and is found in the amniotic cavity. Or omphalocele, a hernia in which abdominal structures move into the umbilical cord.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sorry for the super long explanation, but it just helps me to write it all out!</p>","Embryology, Case 7"

IL-4 is responsible for class-switching to IgE, whereas IL-5 and TGF-B are responsible for class-switching to IgA. The interleukins for class-switching for IgG vary depending on which IgG you are producing (i.e. IgG1, IgG2, etc). This however, has no effect on the affinity of IgG.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>C - I made this up completely</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>D - This actually refers to IgA and why it protects mucosal surfaces. Because it is a dimer with a J-chain connecting it, the J-chain binds specifically to the poly Ig receptor found on the basolateral side of the submucosa. The IgA dimer takes the secretory component of the poly Ig receptor and uses it to pass through the cell, therefore the secretory component protects IgA from degradation as the enzymes in the mucosa cannot attack it. (This means that IgM, which also has J chains, can get into the mucosa as well, but it doesn't do so too well because of it's large size)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>E - This is true, however it does not increase the affinity of IgG.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'm just gonna go through somatic hypermutation a bit now, which might be slightly long so apologies in advance, but you don't have to read it lol!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A dictionary definition of somatic hypermutation is:&nbsp;<em>it enables our immune system to expand the limited diversity encoded within our genomes to the billions of antibody specificities required to defend ourselves against external pathogens.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How does it do this?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Germinal centres are sites within secondary lymphoid organs where mature B lymphocytes proliferate, differentiate, and mutate their antibody genes (through somatic hypermutation), and switch the class of their antibody, during a normal immune response to an infection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When dealing with an infection, the immune response is proliferating every 10-12 hours. That is a&nbsp;<strong>huge</strong> amount of proliferation for eukaryotes. Usually, when making the antibody molecule, DNA polymerase lays down the correct nucleotides, and if it makes a mistake, it will fix it. However, in an infected state, type A DNA polymerase is stressed out and begins to make mistakes (point mutations) in the already made VDJ region of the antibody. Therefore, in somatic hypermutation, there are point mutations in the already made VDJ region resulting in affinity maturation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These point mutations can have 3 different outcomes on the end-product antibody:</p><ol><li>It can&nbsp;<strong>increase</strong> the affinity of the antibody molecule to the antigen</li><li>It can&nbsp;<strong>decrease</strong> the affinity of the antibody molecule to the antigen</li><li><strong>No change</strong></li></ol><p>If the affinity increases, the antigen binds to the antibody, and this results in an increased proliferation of this antibody, therefore we produce an army of clonal bodies where the daughter cells have a higher affinity and are more specific to the antigen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If the affinity decreases, the antibody cannot bind to the antigen as well, and eventually dies off.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If there is no change, then nothing ventured and nothing gained.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, to the crunch of this question, the reason why IgG has the highest affinity, is because at the time when hypermutation is occurring, class switching is also occurring, where IgM is class-switching to IgG, therefore the somatic hypermutation occurs in the IgG antibodies, giving them an increased affinity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v2/n7/images/nrm0701_493a_i2.gif"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""332"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Immunology, Virology, Case 9"

Please don't stress too much over this-if it comes up it will be one question&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So DMD is an X linked recessive condition (which you would be expected to know) thus the father (not stated he has DMD) is irrelevant in this question. However, you know that her brother had the condition, so therefore the mother must be carrier. Knowing this, Mrs Lawrence has &frac12; of being a carrier as she would of have either receive the DMD X chromosome from the mother or the healthy X chromosome from the mother. You know also that her 3 children that are boys are all unaffected. If she were a carrier, the chance of her passing the DMD X chromosome on would be &frac12;. If she weren&rsquo;t a carrier the chances of her passing this DMD X chromosome would be 0, as she doesn&rsquo;t have the affected X chromosome gene (throughout this question, you are assuming that there are no de novo DMD mutations which occurs in 1/3 cases of the disease) . Thus to calculate the total probability you supply multiple all the accumulative probabilities for both possibilities. From this you basically get 1/16 she is a carrier and &frac12; she is not a carrier. After this you can do an Odds Ratio. Basically a ratio of each probability to each you get 1: 8. To finally get the answer however, you need to add up the two numbers of the ratio (1+8=9) and then put the OR of her being a carrier (1) over the total (1/9)</p><p>Thus we can do this table&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""../images/view.php?file=168326"" alt=""no description"" /></p><p>Therefore 1/1+8 =1/9=Correct answer :)&nbsp;</p><p>If I have confused you more, please comment and I'll try and explain it better.

Some individuals (less than 5%) do not make an anti vaccine response (IgG) to HBsAg even after a second round of three boosts (six shots in aggregate total). In order to protect these individuals they are offered a passive administration of anti HBsAg IgG from selected donors (termed Hepatitis B immune globulin or HBIG) with high anti-HBsAg titres (of at least 1:100,000). Please note that it is only anti-HBsAg IgG that gives 'sterilising' protection because it is a high affinity neutralising antibody that prevents virus from entering hepatocytes. Option B is therefore the correct answer as most people have indicated. With this revision it makes for an excellent question. Well done for thinking it up.<br />RJM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q I was just wondering if someone doesn't react to Hepatitis B vaccinations containing HBsAg, why would you give anti-HbsAg IgG?<br />In that case, wouldn't the antibodies administered to that person be anti-HBeAg?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Good points but remember that this is 'passive' and not 'active' immunisation in this scenario. Just because an individual fails to make an 'active' immune response to HBsAg that does not mean they will not still be protected by a 'passive' administration of anti-HBsAg IgG. There has to be anti-HBsAg IgG in the sera that is administered because it's the only anti-HB antibody that will give protection.

The mother explains these symptoms started 2 nights ago after Yograj Jnr's father came home from Abu Dhabi. To celebrate his massive earnings from his forehead modelling career, he decided to have a hog roast and invite all the nieghbours as well (who, Mabli satys have also come down with D+V). The GP checks Yograj Jnr's temperature and records a reading of 38C. The GP now has an idea what is causing poor Yograj Jnr. to feel this way and asks you what the most likely causative agent is and how to treat it.

As the atria and ventricles beat out of sync, when the atria tries to push blood into the ventricles, it meets with the AV valves instead, and thus the blood pushes back into the circulation, causing filling of the jugular veins. This explains why cannon A waves are found on the JVP of a pt with complete heart block.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Perfusing rhythm is maintained by a junctional or ventricular escape rhythm. Alternatively, the patient may suffer ventricular standstill leading to syncope (if self-terminating) or sudden cardiac death (if prolonged).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mechanism</strong>:&nbsp;Complete heart block is essentially the end point of either Mobitz I or Mobitz II AV block:</p><ul><li>It may be due to progressive fatigue of AV nodal cells as per Mobitz I (e.g. secondary to increased vagal tone in the acute phase of an inferior MI).</li><li>Alternatively, it may be due to sudden onset of complete conduction failure throughout the His-Purkinje system, as per Mobitz II (e.g. secondary to septal infarction in acute anterior MI)</li></ul><p><strong>Presentation:&nbsp;</strong>The patient typically presents with bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, dizziness, syncope and severe chest pain. The low HR is associated with a lower than normal cardiac output, and syncope.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ECG</strong>: The ECG is characterised as having no correlation between P and QRS. Because of differences in intrinsic rates of pacemaker tissue, the frequency of P waves is greater than that of the QRS complex.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""http://i1.wp.com/lifeinthefastlane.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/3rd-degree-heart-block.jpg?w=850"" alt="""" width=""409"" height=""103"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the example ECG above, the atrial rate is 100bpm whereas the ventricular rate is 40bpm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The ventricular rate depends on the location of alternate pacemaker; ventricular origination is slowest and least reliable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Risk factors: </strong>The most common cause of heart block is age-related degeneration of tissue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because an acute myocardial infarction (MI) can cause complete heart block (usually an inferior MI), patients who concurrently experience an MI can have associated symptoms from the MI, including chest pain, dyspnoea, nausea or vomiting, and diaphoresis. Third-degree AV block may be an underlying condition in patients who present with sudden cardiac death.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Patients who have a history of cardiac disease may be on medications that affect the conduction system through the atrioventricular node (AVN), including the following:</p><ul><li>Beta-blockers</li><li>Calcium channel blockers</li><li>Digitalis cardioglycosides</li></ul><p><strong>Treatment:&nbsp;</strong>Patients with third degree heart block are at high risk of ventricular standstill and sudden cardiac death.</p><ul><li>They require urgent admission for cardiac monitoring, backup temporary pacing and usually insertion of a permanent pacemaker.</li><li>The&nbsp;<em>best</em> initial therapy is to give the patient&nbsp;<strong>atropine</strong>, as it is the fastest way to increase the heart rate, and is anti-cholinergic, therefore blocking vagal stimulation (which is why outcome of treatment is better with those with heart block secondary to Mobitz type I).

GLP-1 and GIP are incretin hormones, both secreted by endocrine cells that are located in the epithelium of the small intestine. An increase of substances in the lumen of the GI tract (like glucose) triggers the secretion of these hormones. Incretins are carried through the circulation to target tissues: pancreatic beta cells. The incretin stimulation of beta cells causes them to secrete&nbsp;<strong>more</strong> insulin in response to the same amount of glucose.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>GLP-1 is inactivated by an enzyme called&nbsp;<strong>dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP-4)</strong>. This enzyme breaks down the incretin. Sitagliptin works by inhibiting DPP-4 and thus preventing GLP-1 from being inactivated, so more GLP-1 in the circulation allows for an increase in insulin release, decrease in glucagon release and thus an overall&nbsp;<em>decrease</em>&nbsp;in blood glucose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The main side effect of DPP-4 inhibitors is&nbsp;<strong>headaches</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Exenatide</strong> is the other drug that works on GLP-1.

It is a form of unstable angina, meaning that it occurs at rest, often without a predictable pattern. This is in contrast to stable angina, in which chest pain occurs in a predictable pattern during exertion or exercise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Episodes of chest pain caused by Prinzmetal's angina usually occur in clusters, with periods of frequent episodes lasting for a few months followed by weeks or months with no chest pain episodes. The pain usually occurs between midnight and approximately 8:00 AM.

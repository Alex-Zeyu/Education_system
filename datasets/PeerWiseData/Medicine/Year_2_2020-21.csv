This is because the mother could be 'sensitized' to the rhesus antigen, i.e. from a former pregnancy. If the mother is sensitized to the rhesus antigen, anti-D immunoglobulins in her bloodstream will cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells, which leads to haemolytic disease of the newborn. This HDN causes release of billirubin from RBCs, which causes jaundice, and in severe cases brain damage. It is important to note that HDN mostly only occurs when the mother is already sensitized to the rhesus antigen. Sensitizing events, such as miscarriage after 12 weeks and birth, can be treated by injecting a smaller amount of anti-D immunoglobulin into the mother: not enough to cross the placenta, but enough to stop a sensitizing event.&nbsp;</p>","Placenta, Case 8, Physiology of Pregnancy, Blood Groups, Rhesus Incompatibility"

This occurs as the maternal gene for PWS is switched off (genetic imprinting), meaning functionality depends on the father. Whilst PWS can be caused due to a deletion in the parental chromosome at 15q11-13, in this case one will notice the child lacks a paternal chromosome. Uniparental disomy is at play, meaning that the child has inherited a pair of chromosomes from one parent, which can occur after trisomy rescue if a sperm has fertilised a diploid egg. This suggests therefore either answer A or B is correct. As the picture shows, the child has a large line on one of the two maternal chromosomes, rather one of each. This is isodisomy, which occurs from non-disjunction in meiosis II. As such, B is correct.</p>","Unusual patterns of inheritance, Genetics, Case 7, Meiosis, Chromosomal abnormalities"

This may include facial expression, gestures and also the tone of voice.&nbsp; &nbsp;The are various descriptive terms for inappropriate affect. There is some overlap in the terminology.&nbsp; In this situation both blunted, or restricted affect would be reasonable descriptors with blunted being slightly more accurate.&nbsp; Affect is flattened but not completely so.&nbsp; Reaction is blunted but not labile.&nbsp; &nbsp;Shallow is used more for psychopathic personality where the individual does not care.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Blunted Affect&nbsp;</strong>Blunted affect is a common symptom in schizophrenia and related disorders, and refers to a lowered level of the intensity of emotional expression. A person with blunted affect will show little feeling even in emotional situations. As an example, a person with blunted affect may tell a story about being in a car crash but talk little about how it made them feel, speak in a monotone, and not have many facial expressions.</li><li><strong>Restricted Affect&nbsp;</strong>Restricted affect is a reduction in one's expressive range. So, the person describing the car accident may show some feeling and emotion, but it is less than would be expected based on the content of what is being said.</li><li><strong>Flat Affect&nbsp;</strong>Flat affect refers to displaying absolutely no feeling or emotion regardless of the circumstances. This is a step below blunted affect in that it is completely devoid of emotional expression.</li><li><strong>Labile Affect&nbsp;</strong>A person with labile affect shows rapid changes in their emotions that don't seem to relate to any outside situations or seem to be inappropriate for the situation. In other words, if you have labile affect, you would display rapid and repeating shifts in mood or affect. A person with labile affect appears as though they do not have control over their emotions. This type of affect is seen often in neurological disorders such as pseudobulbar affect, in manic episodes during bipolar disorder, and in borderline personality disorder. Labile affect can also result from fatigue, stress/anxiety, and over-stimulation.</li><li><strong>Shallow affect</strong> has a similar meaning to blunted affect, but it is often used to describe the emotional experience of persons with psychopathy. A person with shallow affect will feel little emotion about situations that would expect to elicit specific feelings.</li></ul><p>Reference https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-inappropriate-affect-4767992</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Group 57, Case 10, Clinical, Schizophrenia, Mental Health"

If the pH value moves in the appropriate direction of the P co 2 (i.e., increased pH with decreased P co 2 or decreased pH with increased P co 2 ), a respiratory disorder is the primary disturbance. Similarly, if the pH value does not move in the appropriate direction of the P co 2 , a metabolic disorder is the primary disturbance. In this case, the P cO2 is greater than 45 mmHg (65 mmHg) and the pH moves in the appropriate direction (acidic) and so it is most likely a respiritory disturbance (hypoventilation). This is further supported by the history, which shows signs of respiritory depression after overdosing on codeine.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Step 3- is there any evidence of respiritory or metabolic compensation?&nbsp;</p><p>For a primary respiratory abnormality, calculate the change in pH that would occur if the change in P co 2 were acute (0.08/10 mm Hg change in P co 2 ) or chronic (0.03/10 mm Hg change in P co 2 ).

Normal ICP ranges from 5-15mmHg. Because the cranial compartment is enclosed by a rigid skull, it has a limited ability to accommodate additional volume (the Monro Kellie Hypothesis). When intracranial contents increase in volume (e.g., secondary to tumor, blood, swelling, hydrocephalus), initially, circulating blood and CSF are displaced to offset the extra volume and ICP remains unchanged. However, beyond a certain threshold, if intracranial contents continue to increase in volume, then ICP will quickly increase as there is diminished compliance in the fixed intracranial vault. This dynamic is critical in surgical patients with already decreased intracranial compliance from space occupying lesions (such as a tumour), who may be extremely sensitive to ICP changes associated with anesthetic effects (e.g., cerebral vasodilation from inhalation anesthetics or vasodilation from periods of hypoventilation/hypercapnia).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hyperventilation is one known method of rapidly decreasing ICP.

For primary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, surgery is the preferred method of treatment. Surgically removing the enlarged or overactive parathyroid can permanently cure the parathyroid disorder, with minimally invasive techniques available for certain patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hypoparathyroidism occurs when the body does not produce enough PTH hormone, causing hypocalcemia.&nbsp;Hypoparathyroidism is usually treated with a special form of vitamin D (calcitriol) and with calcium tablets. Calcitrol is an active form of vitamin D (125 dihydroxycholecalcifero) which increases calcium levels by stimulation osteoclasts, reduces excretion in the kidneys and stimulates active calcium reabsorption in jejenum and duodenum.

Hashimoto&rsquo;s Thyroiditis, also known as Hashimoto&rsquo;s disease, is an autoimmune disease that causes the body&rsquo;s immune system to produce antibodies that attack thyroid tissue and damage the gland, leading to an under-productive thyroid. Hypothyroidism can usually be easily treated with thyroid hormone medicine, typically levothyroxine, which is identical to the main thyroid hormone made by the thyroid gland.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hyperthyroidism is a disorder caused by an overactive thyroid that causes the body to speed up. It can cause weight loss, a faster heartbeat, sweating, or feelings of nervousness. Graves&rsquo; Disease is one of the main causes of hyperthyroidism. It is an autoimmune disease, more common in women than men, and can be associated with a special type of eye abnormality (Graves&rsquo; eye disease). If untreated, hyperthyroidism can lead to serious heart, bone and other problems.

In atrial fibrillation, the atria beat irregularly. In atrial flutter, the atria beat regularly, but faster than usual and more often than the ventricles, so you may have four atrial beats to every one ventricular beat. Therefore, Simon has presented with atrial flutter. His management involves rate control over rythm control. Metoprolol and Bisoprolol (beta blockers), Verapamil (calcium channel blocker) and Digitoxin all control rate so they would be appropriate in the treatment of atrial flutter. Flecanide is a rhythm controlling drug.&nbsp;Membrane active rhythm control medications, such as flecainide&nbsp; are not recommended for rate control, because the potential pro-arrhythmic effect outweighs the usefulness of rate control.</p>","Case 12"

Adrenaline is a local vasoconstrictor therefore traps the LA to the region of injection and so extends the drugs half life. The reduction in blood loss due to the vasoconstrictor properties of adrenaline also aids wound cleaning and suturing process.</p><p>Note: be cautious on where you use adrenaline co-administered with LA, if this were his thumb it would be contraindicated as as the thumb is poorly collateralised i.e. alternative circulation is poor as it is a digit therefore the vasoconstriction induced by adrenaline could lead to hypoxia!</p><p>A - incorrect, although adrenaline does stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, in this case, you're only injecting adrenaline locally (and not systemically) therefore this is not the most appropriate answer. In addition, the primary purpose of administering the LA is to reduce his pain, not the adrenaline therefore A is not the single best answer.</p><p>B - incorrect, adrenaline co-administered with LA actually lengthens the drugs half-life as the adrenaline causes local vasoconstriction it keeps the LA in the required site for longer &amp; thus reduces the need to increase the initial dose of LA.</p><p>C- incorrect, this question asks for the benefit of using adrenaline, the LA can ease the pain and make it easier for the suturing process, this is not the primary aim of the adrenaline.</p><p>D- incorrect, sutures bring the skin together to aid the healing process by secondary intention, not the adrenaline!</p>","Wound Healing, Pharmacology"

Her next citizen is Mrs Bloggs, a 29 year old lady who presents to Jenny's pod weeping and in great distress. She explains that last time she had a vaccine, the needle was stuck in her arm and caused great pain. Jenny reassures Mrs Bloggs, and during the consultation Mrs Bloggs stops weeping and appears more calm. Jenny states that she will continue asking questions and talking to her throughout to 'distract her from the pain'. Mrs Bloggs says afterwards she didn't even feel the needle go in. What is the basis for Jenny's distraction technique?&nbsp;</p>","<p>Distracting the patient&nbsp;reduces brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula.</p>","<p>Distracting the patient reduces pain related brain activity in somatosensory cortices (S1, S2) and thalamus</p>","<p>Distracting the patient reduces brain activity in the PFC and basal ganglia.</p>","<p>Distracting the patient reduces pain related brain activity by increasing endogenous opioid production hence inhibiting release of substance P via the acute fight or flight stress response</p>","<p>Distracting the patient reduces the activity of the medial thalamic nuclei.</p>","<p>This is a complicated and hard question admittedly: the key thing here is what has caused the absence/modulation of pain, not the activation of it. This is a convoluted explanation but pain itself is tricky so I hope it helps and any additions to this would be helpful!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B is correct, directly taken from Dr&nbsp;Hassoulas' lecture in Year 1: ""Attentional distraction reduces pain related brain activity in S1, S2, thalamus"". This is part of the lateral pain system, consisting of the lateral thalamic nuclei and somatosensory cortices (S1/S2) affecting sensory discrimination of pain. Distraction decreases the pain activity in this pathway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A) and C) are wrong: this is because distraction actually increases the brain activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC), Anterior Cingulate Cortex and PAG. This may seem paradoxical, but there is an overlap between attention systems and descending pain modulatory systems. &nbsp;Attended stimuli receive preferential neural processing and are likely to govern behaviour.&nbsp;Pain intensity is reduced when pain is perceived to be controllable and pain catastrophizing associated with greater pain intensity: so in this case we may expect Mrs Bloggs to complain of pain due to previous bad experiences and anxiety with the amygdala and emotional memory coming into play here, however again why might she not experience pain? If there is some modulation due to the distraction--&gt;<strong>&nbsp;Pain perceptions occur in the cortex.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>D is a possible answer, it is true that the acute fight or flight stress response may be activated if a person has a phobia of needles for example, this will dampen pain via release of noradrenaline &amp; activation of PAG and endogenous opioids. However, in this case, distracting the patient won't cause the fight or flight response. Though previously distressed, Mrs Bloggs appears calm before her vaccine administration.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>E is incorrect as explained in A and C. Though the medial thalamic nuclei, ACC and insula are involved in affective cognitive evaluative aspects of pain and the ACC does have a key role in pain sensation (as with S1/S2 blocked in stroke patients they can still experience pain) in distraction, to my understanding the ACC attention pathway may be more in play here&nbsp; than in the pain pathway due to the overlap. Again, the way I have worded the response: brain activity in this area does not reduce in distraction, if anything it increases but in a different pathway, the attention pathway, rather than the pain pathway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""../images/view.php?file=462567"" alt=""no description"" /><img src=""../images/view.php?file=462568"" alt=""no description"" /></p>","Neurophysiology, Year 1, pain, spinal tracts"

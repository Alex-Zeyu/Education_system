The phosphorylated phospholamban then means that there is enhanced CaATPase in the SR causing more Ca in the SR. There is therefore increased Ca release and greater force of contraction.

Black developed a drug called propranolol after modifying a structurally similar agent called dichloroisoprenaline. Both dichloroisoprenaline and propranolol are beta-blockers - they inhibit the effects of catecholamines on beta adrenoceptors. Use of propranolol quickly increased following release on the market due to its efficacy treating a variety of heart conditions such as angina (or as treatment following a heart attack) as well as hypertension.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, in 1976 atenolol - a drug in the same class as propranolol - was released, and has since almost completely overtaken use of propranolol for treating these same conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why?</p>","<p>Propranolol is too non-specific and has an action on beta-3 adrenoceptors in addition to beta-1 adrenoceptors; atenolol only has an action on beta-1 adrenoceptors.</p>","<p>Atenolol does not have the same toxicity problems as propranolol when metabolised.</p>","<p>Propranolol is too non-specific and&nbsp;has an effect on beta-2 adrenoceptors in addition to beta-1 adrenoceptors; atenolol only has an action on beta-1 adrenoceptors</p>","<p>Propranolol is too non-specific and&nbsp;has an action on alpha-1 adrenoceptors in addition to beta-2 adrenoceptors; atenolol only has an action on beta-2 adrenoceptors.</p>","<p>Atenolol is less specific than propranolol and therefore has a useful effect on more classes of beta receptor.</p>","<p>The answer is C. Propranolol effects both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors; atenolol only effects beta-1 adrenoceptors. I'll explain why that's better:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Adrenoceptors come in two categories, and there are five types: there are alpha-1 and alpha-2; then there are beta-1, beta-2 and beta-3.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The two most important ones are beta-1 and beta-2. An easy way I was shown to remember their roles or where they're found is that you have <strong>one heart</strong>, so<strong> beta-1</strong> adrenoceptors are found <strong>in the heart;</strong> and you have <strong>two lungs, </strong>so <strong>beta-2</strong> adrenoceptors are found in the lungs (specifically the brochi and bronchioles, as well as any other significant smooth muscle features present).</p><p><br />The fundamental issue with propranolol that isn't apparent when atenolol is used is the unwanted activation of beta adrenoceptors outside the heart and vasculature - specifically, you have <strong>activation</strong> of the <strong>beta-2 adrenoceptors</strong> as well as beta-1, which can cause significant <strong>problems</strong> in any patients with underlying or additional<strong> pulmonary conditions</strong> such as asthma or fibrosis. If you're treating a heart problem and you have one drug with an effect on receptors found only in the cardiac system vs. another drug with effects outside it, you should (all other things being equal) use the more specific drug to treat as there is less potential for adverse or unwanted effects.</p>","Heart, Pharmacology, Drugs for Heart"

Because capillaries are only one cell layer thick, they only have a tunica intima.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The tunica intima is the inner endothelial lining of the blood vessel. It is made up of the endothelium, subendothelium and the internal elastic lamina. It prevents blood reaching other parts of the vessel walls. It has a cobblestone appearance, with no gaps. It is a continuous monolayer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The tunica media is the middle smooth muscle layer. It contains smooth muscle fibres, elastin and collagen. It provides elasticity. A single layer of tunica media is called a lamella. It can be made up of many layers. The autonomic nervous system controls the smooth muscle tension, and adjusts the radius of the lumen by vasocontraction and vasodilation. Arteries have a thick tunica media to limit compliance so that they do not bulge under high pressure which would result in the pressure being lost. Veins have a thin tunica media as they have a high compliance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Tunica Adventitia is the outer connective tissue layer. It is fibrous and helps to attach the vessels to the surrounding tissues. It contains fibroblasts which produce fibres. The tunica adventitia is innervated by the verve vasorum, and the it is supplied by blood vessels called the vasa vasorum.

Macrophages are able to sense the pathogen through a number of cell surface, cytosolic and endosomal &lsquo;Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) that permit recognition of microbe derived components. Macrophages act as the first innate cell to detect the presence of the pathogen and communicate the detection of the pathogen to other cells through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines-IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, TNFalpha and interferons. Some of the key effects of IL-1 and TNFalpha are exerted on local blood vessels causing dilation of capillaries and making the endothelial wall of vessels more permeable. Macrophages, as their name suggests, are also particularly well equipped for carrying out phagocytosis-the engulfment and lysis of bacteria and viruses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dendritic cells are analogous to macrophages in many ways in that they are also located in all peripheral tissues, possess PRRs, secrete inflammatory cytokines and can perform efficient phagocytosis. Importantly, dendritic cells have the additional capacity of being able to migrate from the site of infection via the lymphatic vessels to the nearest draining lymph node (the lymph node nearest the site of infection) where they can present MHC/peptide complexes to the TCRs on T na&iuml;ve T cells.</p>","Immunology"

Answer C refers to C5a proteins, which can produce a response similar to opsonisation, but are more involved in the inflammatory response rather than opsonisation. Answer D refers to the initiation of the inflammatory response, and is nothing to do with opsonisation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is some more detail on opsonisation and the roles of other complement proteins. (This is from the immunology tutorial booklet from PCS 2)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What are the three main effector functions of complement activation?<br />Effector functions:<br />The three main effector functions are C3b mediated opsonisation, C5a induced inflammation and MAC mediated cell lysis</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Opsonisation: C3b gets fixed to pathogens and this C3b fixation, also called opsonisation, is the most important function of C: the now &lsquo;opsonised&rsquo; bacteria can be recognized by phagocytes: the C3b is recognized by CR1 (complement receptor 1) and CR3 (complement receptor 3) on e.g. the surface of neutrophils and this initiates the phagocytosis, followed by intracellular killing. Deficiency of C3 or LP and AP components can lead to increased susceptibility of bacterial infections. (of note: if the bacteria is coated=opsonized by both C3b and IgG, the phagocytosis is much more efficient as 2 receptors on the surface of the phagocyte are involved: CR3; which binds C3b and an Fc-receptor that can bind to the Fc part= constant part of the IgG antibody.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After activation of C3, the TP can be activated resulting in C5 cleavage into C5b (which is the first molecule of the membrane attack complex of complement) and C5a, a pro-inflammatory anaphylatoxin.&nbsp;C5a is an important chemotactic agent and attracts neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages to the site of infection and can also directly activate neutrophils end enhance the ability of neutrophils to phagocytose and kill bacteria. It also has anaphylatoxic properties (vasodilation and bronchoconstriction). In general C5a is pro-inflammatory and excess C5a generation contributes to a variety of pathologies. In many of these diseases it is not complement that initiates the pathology but it is complement that exacerbates it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Membrane attack complex formation: C5b is the first component of the TP. After binding of C6 and C7, the C5bC6C7 (or C5b-7) complex becomes hydrophobic and binds to the membrane, after which C8 and multiple C9 molecules bind and form the transmembrane pore of the membrane attack complex of complement (MAC/C5b-9). This can lead to cell lysis. Deficiency of components of the TP increases the susceptibility to bacterial infection but only by Neisseria species. This further highlights that C3b opsonisation is the most important function in the context of bacterial clearance.</p>","PCS 2, Immunology"

These hormones are normally made in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. Males born with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism often have an unusually small penis (micropenis) and undescended testes (cryptorchidism). At puberty, most affected individuals do not develop secondary sex characteristics, such as the growth of facial hair and deepening of the voice in males, the start of monthly periods (menstruation) and breast development in females, and a growth spurt in both sexes. Without treatment, most affected men and women are unable to have biological children (infertile).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Kallmann syndrome, the sense of smell is either diminished (hyposmia) or completely absent (anosmia). This feature distinguishes Kallmann syndrome from most other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which do not affect the sense of smell.

Boys and girls of all ethnic backgrounds may be affected.</p><p>Floppiness and weak muscles that becomes apparent during or shortly after birth. feeding problems and failure to grow during the first year of life, rapid weight gain in children aged one to six years, characteristic facial features, such as almond-shaped eyes and thin upper lips and<strong> underactive testicles or ovaries (hypogonadism)</strong>, resulting in delayed sexual development&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anorexia Nervosa:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Eating disorders bring with them the possibility of long-term health effects, and disruption to the menstrual cycle is just one of these possibilities. Particularly with <strong>anorexia, low reproductive hormones have been reported in severe cases.&nbsp;I</strong>n anorexics, severe weight loss (resulting in weight of at least 15% less than a normal body weight for the woman&rsquo;s age and height) reduces fat stores in the body which in turn reduce thyroid levels but results in an <strong>increase of the stress hormone cortisol</strong>. This state, known as hypercortisolism, then <strong>reduces reproductive hormones.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Congenital leptin deficiency </strong>is a condition that causes <strong>severe obesity</strong> beginning in the first few months of life. Affected individuals are of normal weight at birth, but they are constantly hungry and quickly gain weight. Without treatment, the extreme hunger continues and leads to chronic excessive eating (hyperphagia) and obesity. Beginning in early childhood, affected individuals develop abnormal eating behaviors such as fighting with other children over food, hoarding food, and eating in secret.</p><p>People with congenital leptin deficiency also have <strong>hypogonadotropic hypogonadism,</strong> which is a condition caused by reduced production of hormones that direct sexual development. Without treatment, affected individuals experience delayed puberty or do not go through puberty, and may be unable to conceive children (infertile)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Turner's syndrome:</strong></p><p>Turner syndrome is related to the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex<br />chromosomes. People typically have two sex chromosomes in each cell: females have<br />two X chromosomes, while males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.<br />Turner syndrome results when one normal X chromosome is present in a female's cells<br />and the other sex chromosome is missing or structurally altered.&nbsp;The<br />most common feature of Turner syndrome is short stature, which becomes evident<br />by about age 5. An early loss of ovarian function (ovarian hypofunction or premature<br />ovarian failure) is also very common. The ovaries develop normally at first, but egg<br />cells (oocytes) usually die prematurely and most ovarian tissue degenerates before<br />birth. Many affected girls do not undergo puberty unless they receive hormone therapy,<br />and most are unable to conceive (infertile).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kallman's syndrome:</strong>&nbsp;Kallmann syndrome is a condition characterized by delayed or absent puberty and an impaired sense of smell.</p><p>This disorder is a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is a condition resulting from a lack of production of certain hormones that direct sexual development. These hormones are normally made in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. Males born with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism often have an unusually small penis (micropenis) and undescended testes (cryptorchidism). At puberty, most affected individuals do not develop secondary sex characteristics, such as the growth of facial hair and deepening of the voice in males, the start of monthly periods (menstruation) and breast development in females, and a growth spurt in both sexes.

As blood flow increases, the pressure increases, and the collapsed vessels open , lowering overall resistance. This process of opening of the capillaries is primary mechanism for the fall in pulmonary vascular resistance when cardiac output increases.

It is usually found at low levels in the blood. High levels suggest a pre-hepatic jaundice caused by increased breakdown of RBCs, e.g.&nbsp;haemolytic sickle cells disease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conjugated bilirubin</strong> is formed from unconjugated bilirubin in the liver. It is water soluble, and is secreted into bile and enters the intestine, where it is broken down by bacteria and forms the dark colour of stools. Usually there is no conjugated bilirubin in the blood, however in intrahepatic (e.g. hepatitis) or post-hepatic (e.g. bile duct blockage) jaundice the conjugated bilirubin enters the blood. It can then be excreted via the kidneys, which is why urine appears dark.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ALP</strong> is alkaline phosphatase. It is an enzyme produced in the liver (especially in the ducts) as well as bone. High levels suggests post-hepatic jaundice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ALT</strong> is alanine transferase. It is an enzyme produced in the liver as well small amounts in the heart, kidneys and skeletal muscles. High levels in the blood suggest intrahepatic jaundice, e.g. acute hepatitis, and moderately high levels suggest chronic hepatitis or post-hepatic jaundice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AST</strong> is aspartate aminotransferase. It is also an enzyme produced in the liver, kidneys, heart and skeletal muscle. High levels suggest acute hepatitis, and moderate levels suggest chronic hepatitis or post-hepatic jaundice. Also, if AST levels are higher than ALT levels it suggests liver damage due to alcohol.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Answer A suggests pre-hepatic jaundice.</p><p>Answer B suggests intrahepatic jaundice, most likely caused by acute, viral hepatitis.</p><p>Answer C suggest post-hepatic jaundice, most likely caused by gallstones.</p><p>Answer D suggest intrahepatic jaundice, most likely caused by chronic hepatitis.</p>","Case 3, Liver, Liver function tests"

However, the situation may be different in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease&mdash;there is evidence that microglia may become hyperactivated, promoting neuroinflammation that can lead to the characteristic toxic protein deposits seen in Alzheimer&rsquo;s (amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles). Finally, recent work shows that microglia play a role in the developing brain. Normally, far more synapses are created than are needed, with only the strongest, most important ones surviving. Microglia directly contribute to this synaptic &lsquo;pruning&rsquo; process by eating up the synapses tagged as unnecessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Astrocytes</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Astrocytes are star-shaped cells that maintain a neuron&rsquo;s working environment. They do this by controlling the levels of neurotransmitter around synapses, controlling the concentrations of important ions like potassium, and providing metabolic support.</p><p>But astrocytes don&rsquo;t just maintain the environment around synapses. An active area of research addresses how astrocytes modulate how neurons communicate. Because astrocytes have the ability to sense neurotransmitter levels in synapses, and can respond by releasing molecules that directly influence neuronal activity, astrocytes are increasingly seen as important for modifying synapses.</p><p>The blood&ndash;brain barrier is composed of high-density cells restricting passage of substances from the bloodstream much more than do the endothelial cells in capillaries elsewhere in the body. Astrocyte cell projections called astrocytic feet (also known as ""glia limitans"") surround the endothelial cells of the BBB, providing biochemical support to those cells.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oligodendrocytes</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oligodendrocytes provide support to axons of neurons in the central nervous system, particularly those that travel long distances within the brain. They produce a fatty substance called myelin, which is wrapped around axons as a layer of insulation. Similar in function to insulation layers around power cables, the myelin sheath allows electrical messages to travel faster awhite matter&mdash;the white is the myelin wrapped around axons. Multiple sclerosis is caused by a loss of the myelin sheath around neurons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ependymal cells</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ependymal cells line the spinal cord and ventricles of the brain.

Your grandfather's cirrhosis is due to&nbsp;<strong>Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</strong>, which has obesity and diabetes as risk factors.

They are a result of persistent vomiting, usually due to alcohol consumption.

This may result in arterial wall damage, thus leading to vessel irregularity, aneurysm formation or thrombosis. Aneurysm can cause compression of the sensory branch of the ulnar nerve.1</p><p>HHS is usually found in men of working age with occupations that involve repetitive blunt trauma to the hands, this has also been observed in athletes with sports-related injuries. Patients may present with a tender mass in the hypothenar eminence, pain in the palm, numbness in the fourth and fifth fingers, and ischaemia of the fourth and fifth fingers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although the diagnosis can be confirmed easily with sonography, by showing ulnar artery thrombosis or aneurysm, MRI and MR angiography (MRA) provide a comprehensive evaluation of the hypothenar region. MRI can be used to evaluate osteochondral, neural, vascular, tendinous and ligamentous structures. MRA can be useful in detecting early changes of arterial wall thickening, irregularity and aneurysms. MRA is also useful in demonstrating the site of segmental occlusion of the ulnar artery.2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Patients with HHS are advised rest from the offending activity, smoking cessation and therapy with vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers. The thrombosed segments are usually treated with surgical excision and reconstruction with a vein graft.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The differential diagnosis for HHS includes benign tumours of the hand including lipomas, schwannomas, vascular malformations and ganglion cysts, which can mimic ulnar artery aneurysms. Thromboangiitis Obliterans (Buerger&rsquo;s disease) can present as an irregularity; it has a corkscrew appearance on MRA of the hand, and can mimic HHS. However, involvement of digital arteries in the former while involvement around the wrist joint in HHS will help in differentiating these two entities. Thus, in appropriate clinical settings, MR and MRA can conclusively diagnose HHS by depicting aneurysm formation and the pathognomonic &lsquo;corkscrew&rsquo; appearance.3</p>","Anatomy, Upper limb, Clinical Significance"

Here adrenaline (epinephrine) is released from the adrenal cortex in response to external stimuli. Here adrenaline is an example of endocrine signalling. Once the adrenaline reaches the target cells, which in this case is the muscle, it attaches to the adrenorecptor on the cell membrane, activating the G protein coupled receptor. G protein receptor will then activate adenylyl cyclase enzyme, which will bind with ATP to prodeuce cAMP + PPi (aka Pyrophosphate) The G protein acts as an intermediate between the receptor and the synthesis of cAMP. This increase in production of cAMP activates protein Kinase A. Protein kinase A then goes on to develop the cascade by activating or inactivatting certain enzymes, which causes the production of the product.

The rest (i.e. majority of dosrum surface) is supplied by the superficial fibular nerve, so here again you should be thinking <em>""something's wrong with the superficial nerve.""</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;(this link shows you the foot dermatomes, in case you're a bit lost: <a class=""enteredLink"" href=""http://www.frca.co.uk/images/lowerlimb-fig8-small.jpg"" target=""_blank"">http://www.frca.co.uk/images/lowerlimb-fig8-small.jpg</a>)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now you can look back at the fact that his fracture is located at the midshaft of his fibula; what runs&nbsp;close along&nbsp;it there?

Just look at their name: medial <strong>plantar</strong>, lateral <strong>plantar</strong>. The patient however suffers from loss of sensation on the dorsal surface!</p><p>2) As for the Saphenous nerve, it supplies the skin on the medial side of the foot as far as the head of the first metatarsal. It has no contribution to foot eversion. So it can't be this nerve.</p><p>3) Deep Fibular nerve doesn't contribute to foot eversion, but dorsiflexion and extension of the toes. It also supplies the skin at the first interdigital cleft,&nbsp;an area that&nbsp;the patient hasn't lost sensation in. So again it can't be this nerve.</p><p>&nbsp;This leaves us with superficial fibular nerve as the only answer :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>*Additional info:</p><p>Something you might find interesting is that the deep fibular nerve injury causes a foot drop!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Foot, Anatomy, Innervation, Innervations, Lower Limb"

However, in clinical practice, when taking a <strong>history</strong> of a <strong>patient</strong> it is important to <strong>check</strong> drug history for such <strong>contraindications.</strong> Although it is possible that some of the patients may be on other drugs which are interfering with the metabolism of codeine, it is less likely.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On balance, this is an SBA and C provides the best explanation</p>","PCS 3, PCS Unit 3, Case 1, PCS3, Pharmacology"

Therefore conditions such as asthma are characterised as obstructive as they see bronchoconstriction, resulting in a more narrow lumen and reduced flow. This is observed in a FEV1/FVC ratio, the forced expiratory flow in one second is reduced. Therefore a FEV1/FVC of less than 70% would be indicative of COPD. Salbutamol is a&nbsp;&beta;2 agonist, hence it causes smooth muscle dilation, resulting in greater air flow.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Restrictive</strong> lung disease is characterised by a reduction in lung volume.

Soon after her 88th birthday, she said, she noticed ""a change."" What sort of change? we queried.</em></p><p><em>""Delightful!"" she exclaimed. ""I thoroughly enjoyed it. I felt more energetic, more alive &mdash; I felt young once again. I took an interest in the young men. I started to feel, you might say, 'frisky' &mdash; yes frisky.""</em></p><p><em>""This was a problem?""</em></p><p><em>""No, not at first. I felt well, extremely well &mdash; why should I think anything was the matter?""</em></p><p><em>""And then?""</em></p><p><em>""My friends started to worry. First they said, 'You look radiant &mdash; a new lease on life!,' but then they started to think it was not quite &mdash; appropriate. 'You were always so shy,' they said, 'and now you're a flirt. You giggle, you tell jokes &mdash; at your age, is that right?'""</em></p><p><em>""And how did you feel?""</em></p><p><em>""I was taken aback. I'd been carried along, and it didn't occur to me to question what was happening. But then I did. I said to myself, 'You're 89, Natasha, this has been going on for a year. You were always so temperate in feeling &mdash; and now this extravagance! You're an old woman, nearing the end. What could justify such a sudden euphoria?' And as soon as I thought of euphoria, things took on a new complexion&hellip; 'You're sick, my dear,' I said to myself. 'You're feeling too well, you have to be ill!'""</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What do you diagnose Natasha with?</p>","<p>UTI</p>","<p>Stroke in anterior cerebral artery</p>","<p>Alzheimer's disease</p>","<p>Syphilis</p>","<p>Adrenal gland tumour&nbsp;</p>","<p>This extract is taken from 'The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales' - which is very interesting. Natasha has self-diagnosed herself with syphilis, which can go unnoticed at the time of contraction and cause neurological changes in it's later stages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A) UTI - UTI's in older people are known to give delirium, but this would have likely presented more as confusion as opposed to behavioural changes</p><p>B) stroke in ACA - ACA supplies the frontal lobe, and so behavioural changes may well be observed. However, motor symptoms on the contralateral side of the stroke would also be observed. However, Phineas Gage had a frontal lobe injury and only had personality changes, so perhaps a minor stroke could also only cause personality changes.</p><p>C) Alzheimer's disease is caused by plaques and tangles, and effects memory most noticeably</p><p>E) An adrenal gland tumour could possibly increase levels of testosterone produced (which is responsible for sex drive), however there would be other symptoms present like Cushing's syndrome which is caused by prolonged exposure to cortisol (gives weight gain above &nbsp;the neck, high blood pressure etc).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the rest of the extract, for those interested;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>""Ill? Emotionally? Mentally ill?""</p><p>""No, not emotionally &mdash; physically ill. It was something in my body, my brain, that was making me high. And then I thought &mdash; goddam it, it's Cupid's Disease!""</p><p>""Cupid's Disease?"" I echoed, blankly. I have never heard of the term before.</p><p>""Yes, Cupid's Disease &mdash; syphilis, you know. I was in a brothel in Salonika, nearly 70 years ago. I caught syphilis &mdash; lots of the girls had it &mdash; we called it 'Cupid's Disease.' My husband saved me, took me out, had it treated. That was years before penicillin, of course. Could it have caught up with me after all these years?""</p><p>There may be an immense latent period between the primary infection and the advent of neurosyphilis, especially if the primary infection has been suppressed, not eradicated. I had one patient, treated with Salvarsan by Ehrlich himself, who developed tabes dorsalis &mdash; one form of neurosyphilis &mdash; more than 50 years later.</p><p>But I had never heard of an interval of seventy years &mdash; nor of a self-diagnosis of syphilis mooted so calmly and clearly.</p><p>""That's an amazing suggestion,"" I replied after some thought. ""It would have never occurred to me &mdash; but perhaps you are right.""</p><p>She was right; the spinal fluid was positive, she did have neurosyphilis, it was indeed the spirochetes stimulating her ancient cerebral cortex. Now the question of treatment arose. But here another dilemma presented itself, propounded, with typical acuity, by Mrs. K herself.</p><p>""I don't know that I want it treated,"" she said. ""I know it's an illness, but it's made me feel well. I've enjoyed it, I still enjoy it, I won't deny it. It's made me feel livelier, friskier, than I have in 20 years. It's been fun. But I know when a good thing goes to far, and stops being good. I've had thoughts, I've had impulses, I won't tell you, which are &mdash; well, embarrassing and silly. It was like being a little tiddly, a little tipsy, at first, but if it goes any further&hellip;""</p><p>She mimed a drooling, spastic dement. ""I guessed I had Cupid's, that's why I came to you. I don't want it to get worse, that would be awful; but I don't want it cured &mdash; that would be just as bad. I wasn't fully alive until the wrigglies got me. Do you think you could keep it just as it is?""</p><p>We thought for a while, and our course, mercifully, was clear. We have given her penicillin, which has killed the spirochetes, but can do nothing to reverse the cerebral changes, the disinhibitions, they have caused.</p><p>And now Mrs. K. has it both ways, enjoying a mild disinhibition, a release of thought and impulse, without any threat to her self-control or further damage to her cortex. She hopes to live, thus reanimated, rejuvenated, to a hundred. ""Funny thing,"" she says. ""You've got to give it to Cupid.""</p>","Neurology, Case 2, Case 6, STIs"

To get this answer, you would need to know that the pituitary gland sits inferior to the optic chiasm (so enlargement can lead to compression of the optic chiasm) and that it (the anterior lobe) secretes prolactin, which would cause her symptoms.</p><p>It could not be Sheehan's Syndrome, as this is a condition where the pituitary is damaged by a combination of becoming larger (and therefore having a higher demand for blood supply) during pregnancy, then becoming ischaemic if there is any haemorrhaging during parturition. Therefore, the pituitary lobes may no longer secrete sufficient amounts of hormones. This patient had never given birth, and seemed to be suffering from an excess of prolactin hormone from the anterior pituitary lobe (adenohypophysis) that was causing breast growth and lactation, rather than an insufficiency. This indicates that this is not the best answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the best answer is pituitary adenoma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With regards to the visual defects, these arise from the fact that lesions at the optic chiasm that affect both eyes are always bitemporal hemianopia (aka bitemporal hemianopsia). Bitemporal describes that both eyes (bi) are affected on the temporal (towards the temporal bone) side rather than the nasal (towards the nose) side. Hemianopsia indicates that half (semi) of the visual field is damaged/blinded (anopia). Both hemianopia and hemianopsia are used.</p><p><img src=""../images/view.php?file=233299"" alt=""no description"" /></p><p>Just for revision purposes, the pituitary gland sits in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone. The optic chasm is directly above it.</p><p>The anterior lobe can be called the adenohypophysis, and connects to the hypothalamus via a portal vein. Secretes FSH, LH, prolactin, GH. TSH, ACTH.</p><p>The posterior lobe is like an extension of the hypothalamus in that it is directly connected to it, hence it can be called the neurohypophysis. It releases ADH (vasopressin) and oxytocin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks, please let me know if this is unclear or incorrect - I know there are probably other conditions that can cause bitemporal hemianopia which is why I added the symptoms of lactation and breast growth to indicate that it is related to enlargement of the pituitary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Eye, Eyes, Clinical Anatomy, Clinical Significance"

It is sometimes given alongside <strong>vitamin D supplements</strong> (since vitamin D is one of the f<strong>at-soluble vitamins</strong>, and so Orlistat can increase risk of deficiencies) and the doctor will often give <strong>dietary advice</strong> (if you eat fatty foods with Orlistat, you can exacerbate side effects such as abdominal pain and steatorrhoea).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How Does Orlistat Work?</strong></p><p>Orlistat works by <strong>inhibiting lipase</strong>, which would normally break down triacylglycerides in the intestine so that fatty acids can no longer be absorbed. This means that fat passes straight through the GIT, hence why people find they have <strong>steatorrhoea</strong> when taking it. Other side effects include <strong>abdominal distention</strong> and <strong>pain</strong>, faecal incontinence and urgency, and liquid stools. Eating less fat will decrease most of the side effects, and if a meal contains no fat then the patient can miss their Orlistat dose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Does Orlistat Work?</strong></p><p>Orlistat has a modest effect, but is not given alone - it <strong>should be combined with lifestyle and weightloss advice</strong> too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who can take Orlistat?</strong></p><p>Orlistat can be given as a <strong>prescription</strong> from a doctor.

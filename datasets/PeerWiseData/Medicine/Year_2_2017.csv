He is not on any medication apart from testosterone hormone therapy, which he only started 2 months ago. You ask how the therapy is going and&nbsp;Alex explains that he normally has periods but this month's has only been spotting, so he assumes it is due to the testosterone.

This is from the Blood Transfusion and Blood Groups Lecture in Case 8</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest risk of fatality is a patient receiving an ABO-incompatible transfusion. This may be due to:</p><ul><li>Blood taken from the wrong person.</li><li>Blood incorrectly labelled when it is taken.</li><li>Clinical team puts unit of blood on the wrong person.</li><li>Lab team may mislabel blood.</li></ul><p>IgM antibodies are produced against A and B antigens. These antibodies are very potent and a therefore a small amount of the wrong ABO blood can cause destruction of RBCs and intravascular destruction which can be life-threatening.</p><p><br />There is a 20% chance of ending up on ITU, having renal failure or death if someone is given the wrong blood type.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second biggest risk of transfusion is TACO (transfusion associated circulatory overload) &ndash; giving too much blood to a patient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The third biggest risk is TRALI (transfusion related acute lung injury) &ndash; where antibodies in plasma components (platelets/FFP) degranulate neutrophils in the lungs of the patient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Serious hazards of transfusion have to be reported to a national body &ndash; Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haemolytic disease of the newborn occurs if a rhesus negative mother has a rhesus positive baby. If the mother has had a sensitisation event (i.e. mixing of maternal and Rh+ foetal blood in a previous pregnancy) then she produces IgG antibodies against Rh+. Therefore if a second baby is Rh+ these antibodies will cause haemolytic disease of the newborn, which at its worse results in stillbirth.</p>","case 8, Haematology"

Often it produces few symptoms.Most people have high blood pressure which may cause poor vision or headaches. Occasionally there may be muscular weakness, muscle spasms, tingling sensations, or excessive urination. Complications include cardiovascular disease such as stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, and abnormal heart rhythms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Primary hyperaldosteronism has a number of causes. About 66% of cases are due to enlargement of both adrenal glands and 33% of cases are due to an adrenal adenoma that produces aldosterone. Other uncommon causes include adrenal cancer and an inherited disorder called familial hyperaldosteronism. Some recommend screening people with high blood pressure who are at increased risk while others recommend screening all people with high blood pressure for the disease. Screening is usually done by measuring the aldosterone-to-renin ratio in the blood with further testing used to confirm positive results. While low blood potassium is classically described this is only present in about a quarter of people.

Her symptoms match dengue haemorrhagic fever though with the week in Northern Australia likely to be the cause of this. Dengue fever is also endemic to Northern Australia and during her time there she must have been bitten by another mosquito, infecting her with a different strain of the virus (there are 4 different strains). This was the cause of her then going on to develop the severe haemorrhagic form of the disease. Being infected with two or more different strains of the virus at the same time increases the risk of developing the severe haemorrhagic form, even though it is still very rare. Dengue fever is also transmitted by mosquitos as hinted at in the history.

Glucocorticoids are corticosteroids that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), that is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell. The name glucocorticoid (glucose + cortex + steroid) is composed from its role in regulation of glucose metabolism, synthesis in the adrenal cortex.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Glucocorticoids such as Prednisolone can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. The antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Prednisolone reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. On binding, the corticoreceptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing an increase or decrease in expression of specific target genes, including suppression of IL2 (interleukin 2) expression.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See Cardiff Core formulary for more.&nbsp;</p>","Case 10, Case 9, Immunology"

It was an inactivated virus, being inactivated with formaldehyde. This prevented it from being infectious. It was administered as an injection resulting in the production of IgG antibodies.

However, this vaccine still allowed for infection via the GI tract and as such would not offer herd immunity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Sabin vaccine, created in the 1960s was administered orally. This allowed for protection of the GI tract with IgA antibodies as well as IgG anitbodies protecting the CNS. The vaccine was attenuated.

slides.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>DA, NA and A have a catechol nucleus and an ethyl-amine group attached at the 1 position and are all derived from one biosynthesis pathway, the Catecholamine synthesis pathway.</p><p>All are derived from the amino acid tyrosine in the diet. Tyrosine is actively transported across the blood brain barrier (BBB), which is fully saturated with typical daily intake. <strong>This is part of the rate limiting step of this pathway. (Note: It is also the reason why we have to treat Parksinson&rsquo;s disease with L-DOPA rather than tyrosine supplements, to avoid this step.)</strong><br />In the brain tyrosine at the 3 position is hydroxylated by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) which requires Fe2+, a molecular oxygen and a hydrogen donor (tetrahydrobiopterin) to form Levodopa (L-DOPA). Increased release of catecholamines leads to an increase in TH activity which is regulated at transcriptional, translational and posttranscriptional levels.</p><p>In dopaminergic neurons L-DOPA is converted to DA by the enzyme L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) which can be found in the cytoplasm of these neurons. AADC requires a co-factor derived from Vit B6.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In noradrenergic neurons DA is converted to NA by the enzyme dopamine-&beta;-hydroxylase (DBH). DBH requires Cu2+ and VitC as co-factors and is linked to the synaptic vesicles that store NA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the few neurons found in the adrenal medulla and brainstem that produce Adrenaline an additional enzyme Phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) is expressed. For this step a methyl donor is required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","case 12, Pharmacology, Psychology"

terminal amine group on the carbon chain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Serotonin is synthesised from the amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan is also actively transported across the blood brain barrier, where it is hydroxylated by tryptophan hydroxlase (TPH) to produce 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HT).

However, the fact that he is tachypnoeic suggests that he is trying to compensate by reducing his PaCO2. This will cause a respiratory alkalosis. If there are no abnormal signs in his chest, oxygenation should be relatively normal.&nbsp;Breathing 40% oxygen we would expect a PaO2 around 30 kPa however, with tachypnoea, the facemask is probably delivering less than 40% oxygen and so his oxygenation is unimpaired. The patient has a borderline acidaemia with a pH<br />just below the normal range. The PaCO2 is decreased, causing a respiratory alkalosis and therefore not the cause of the primary disturbance. The base excess and bicarbonate are both decreased confirming that there is a metabolic acidosis. However, the pH is not as low as would be expected for<br />this degree of change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In summary, the patient has a metabolic acidosis (as a result of impaired glucose metabolism and the production of ketoacids) with a compensatory respiratory alkalosis.

Formed of leaked extracellular lipids. Hard exudates are found principally in the macular region and as the lipids coalesce and extend into the central macula (fovea), vision can be severely compromised.</p><p>E-As the retina becomes more ischaemic new blood vessels may arise from the optic disc or in the periphery of the retina. The vessels usually originate from large veins and are initially seen as fine tufts on the surface of the disc or from the vessels of the major arcades of vessels. The new vessels are fragile and bleed easily, hence the importance of proliferative retinopathy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>http://www.glycosmedia.com/education/diabetic-retinopathy/diabetic-retinopathy-features-of-diabetes-neovascularisation/</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Eye, Case 10, Case 16, ISCE, Imaging"

I also surprised at the botulism cases in the UK (see article) - only 62 cases since 1922, and 2 of those were due to meat sourced from Poland! (<em>Niech yje Polska</em>!)

Your baby will not get her first whooping cough vaccine until she is 2 months old.<br />After receiving a whooping cough vaccine, your body will create protective antibodies (proteins produced by the body to fight off diseases) and pass some of them to your baby before birth. These antibodies provide your baby some short-term protection against whooping cough in early life. These antibodies can also protect your baby from some of the more serious complications that come along with whooping cough.<br />Your protective antibodies are at their highest about 2 weeks after getting the vaccine. So you should get the vaccine late in your pregnancy, preferably during your 27th through 36th week, to give your baby the most protection when she is born.<br />The amount of whooping cough antibodies in your body decreases over time.

(The re-entrant rhythm is less likely to interact with tissue that has become refractory). The class III agents exhibit reverse-use dependence (their potency increases with slower heart rates, and therefore improves maintenance of sinus rhythm).

They decrease conduction through the AV node, and shorten phase two (the plateau) of the cardiac action potential.

She's had quite severe morning sickness with this pregnancy, but more recently she has been suffering with some newer symptoms: a sore tongue, fatigue, breathlessness and also sometimes faintness. It's getting her mood down and means she can't be as active and her husband suggested she come in to get checked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""../images/view.php?file=282266"" alt=""Pregnant woman"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You talk to someone more senior, who asks you to take a blood sample and bring them the results - which are as follows:</p><ul><li>Hb&nbsp; 98g/L &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (115-165g/L)</li><li>Ferritin 90&mu;g/L&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (40-200&mu;g/L)</li><li>MCV 110 fL/red cell &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (80-100 fL/red cell)</li><li>WCC&nbsp; 8.0 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (4-11 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L)</li><li>Platelets 220 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (150-400 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L)</li></ul><p>Which of the following diagnoses is the best supported by your findings?</p>","<p>Folate (B9) deficiency anaemia</p>","<p>Pulmonary embolism (PE)</p>","<p>Iron deficiency anaemia</p>","<p>Gestational thrombocytopenia</p>","<p>B12 deficiency anaemia</p>","<ul><li>The patient is breathless and breathlessness is a relatively common symptom of a pulmonary embolism (though they can be completely asymptomatic); however, neither her investigations nor her other features such as the sore tongue and her active lifestyle support a PE, so 'B' is not a wrong answer but it is not the best.</li><li>The platelet count is completely normal so 'D' is a wrong answer.</li><li>'A', 'C' and 'E' are all supported by her low Haemoglobin result, but 'C' is unlikely because her ferritin result is normal as well.</li><li>'A' and 'E' are hard to distinguish. However, B12 stores last for up to 2 years in the body and she has said she has a balanced diet (incidentally if she was a vegan 'E' might be more likely); though folate stores usually last for up to 4 months without sufficient intake and 4 months have not gone by, our patient is carrying twins and she has also had very severe morning sickness; both of these increase risk of a folate deficiency.</li></ul><p>In summary, though iron deficiency anaemia is generally the most common cause of anaemia (75% of cases), in this scenario 'A' is best supported by the clinical picture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Complications in pregnancy, case 8, Pregnancy, Serology, Tests"

Firstly the patient is over 50 which is an important risk factor for spinal stenosis. Moreover there is noticeable pain on extension.

This is because CN III innervates the superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus and inferior oblique muscles of the eye. Damage to this nerve therefore results in the unopposed action of lateral rectus and superior oblique which abduct and pull the eye in and down respectively. Therefore their combined effects pull the eye down and out. CN III also innervates the eye lid so ptosis can occur if damage occurs, as well as pupil dilation as CN III innervates sphincter pupillae (muscles responsible for constriction of the pupil).&nbsp;</p><p>CN III exists the cranium through the superior orbital fissure (along with CN IV, CN V1 and CN VI).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A - CN I</p><p>B - CNV3</p><p>C - CN VII, CN VIII</p><p>D - CN IX, X, XI</p>","Cranial Nerves, Neuroanatomy, Case 16, neurology"

Consultant, on their ward round. Dr Consultant describes five patient cases with five separate conditions:</p><ul><li>Amy, a 25 year old accountant with a symptomatic Chiari type I malformation</li><li>Sam, a 4 year old boy with a small, communicating, lateral ventricle choroid plexus papilloma</li><li>Ariel, a 56 year old decorator with severe extradural haemorrhage following trauma</li><li>Rachel, a 18 year old first year university student with meningitis and a brain abscess</li><li>John, a retired 77 year old man with a large subdural haemorrhage after a car accident</li></ul><p>After explaining the correct procedure and risks of a lumbar puncture, Consultant turns to you. Which of her five patients&nbsp;<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong><em>is not</em></strong></span>&nbsp; at risk of tonsillar herniation (aka 'coning') if a lumbar puncture is performed?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""../images/view.php?file=283212"" alt=""Tonsillar herniation"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>above: Tonsillar herniation example</em></p>","<p>Amy</p>","<p>Sam</p>","<p>Ariel</p>","<p>Rachel</p>","<p>John</p>","<p>The correct answer is 'B' because it is the only scenario of the five where raised intracranial pressure can be communicated with the spinal canal. A lumbar puncture on Sam in 'B' would not create a pressure gradient between the point of puncture and the cranium whereas in all the others there is a risk of this occurring. Below is a little more information on why each case does or doesn't risk coning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Chiari malformation means the cerebellum is abnormally shaped and positioned and extends into the spinal canal, which really raises the risk of compressing the brainstem; symptoms can manifest as caused by a raised ICP (feeling and being sick, severe headache, neck pain, blurred vision etc.).</li><li>Sam's choroid plexus papilloma is causing a communicating hydrocephalus; this means he will be producing too much CSF, but that it can still leave the cranium. If it was obstructive it may risk herniation because lumbar puncture in that instance might create a pressure gradient.</li><li>Ariel has a large extradural haemorrhage so there will be lots of blood raising the ICP. Because the extradural space does not communicate with the spinal canal a lumbar puncture would again create a pressure gradient.</li><li>Rachel's abscess counts as a space occupying lesion, which if big enough will raise the ICP.</li><li>John risks herniation for the same reason as Ariel; the blood is occupying space in the cranium and raising the pressure, and the subdural space created by the bleed doesn't communicate with the spinal canal. However, if John or Ariel was suffering from a subarachnoid haemorrhage I think it should communicate and not risk coning. With that said I don't know if or why you would perform lumbar puncture on someone with a subarachnoid haemorrhage.</li></ul>","Meningitis, Neuroanatomy, Case 16, Clinical skills"

Furthermore, the fact that she went through menopause late is also a risk factor as people over 55 generally have an increased risk of developing breast cancer due to being exposed to high levels of oestrogen for a longer period of time. This is also the case in women who started their periods early (i.e before 12). Also, Catherine has no children and this is also believed to increase a person's risk of developing breast cancer.&nbsp;</p>","case 8"

This leads to an activation of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK)<br />3. This causes a decreased expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase<br />4.

This can interfere with blood vessels in the frontal lobes and cause increases in ICP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>C - <strong>Tonsillar</strong> herniation, also known as <strong>coning</strong> or downward cerebellar herniation, occurs when the <strong>tonsils of the cerebellum</strong> move down through the <strong>foramen magnum</strong>. This causes compression of the brain stem, particularly the medulla, which causes problems with respiration and cardiac function, and can also cause<strong> loss of consciousness</strong> due to compression of the ascending reticular activating system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>D - <strong>Transcalvarial</strong>&nbsp;or external herniation is when the brain squeezes through a <strong>fracture or surgical site</strong> in the skull.

Treatment is not usually indicated, and children, adolescents, and young adults in particular can be monitored in general practice. Monitoring of alanine aminotransferase levels, HBeAg, and anti-HBe at least every six months has been recommended, with specialist referral if fluctuations in alanine aminotransferase levels are observed. Around 1.7-4.5% of children and adolescents infected at birth have cirrhosis at liver biopsy and hepatocellular carcinoma can occur.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Immune clearance phase</strong><br />The immune clearance phase is associated with positivity for HBeAg, high levels of hepatitis B virus DNA (usually &gt;20&thinsp;000 IU/mL, and increased alanine aminotransferase levels. During this phase, patients may spontaneously seroconvert from being positive to negative for HBeAg with development of antibodies to HBeAg (anti-HBe). A prolonged immune clearance phase may be associated with progressive fibrosis and development of cirrhosis. These patients require specialist review and consideration of antiviral treatment with the aim of reducing progression to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Immune control phase</strong><br />The immune control phase is characterised by being negative for HBeAg, positive for anti-HBe, low or undetectable levels of hepatitis B virus DNA (usually &lt;2000 IU/mL) and alanine aminotransferase levels within normal range. These patients usually do not require specialist review unless cirrhosis is a concern. Surveillance for liver cancer by ultrasonography every six months may be indicated. Patients in this phase are sometimes referred to as inactive carriers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Immune escape phase</strong><br />The immune escape phase represents reactivation of the hepatitis B virus and is characterised by chronic infection with negativity for HBeAg, increased levels of hepatitis B virus DNA (usually &gt;2000 IU/mL), and fluctuating alanine aminotransferase levels. Such patients are at high risk of progression to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and require specialist review.</p>","Case 9"

Once sulfasalazine is ingested, about 30% of the intact molecule is absorbed in the upper GI tract either to be carried by the enterohepatic circulation, or to be excreted in the urine by the kidneys. The remaining 2/3rd of the intact sulfasalazine molecule ultimately passes down the lower GI tract, where the intestinal bacterial enzymes cleave the di-azo bond, thus releasing Sulfapyridine and 5-ASA. Sulfapyridine has a bioavailability of 60% (better absorbed) whereas 5-ASA has a bioavailability of 10-30%. It is the circulating levels of Sulfapyridine that are responsible for the principle clinical toxicity and side effects of Sulfasalazine (i.e. agranulocytosis and hypospermia), especially in those who are slow acetylators. Meanwhile, the 5-ASA remains in the bowel lumen, where it is thought to exert its therapeutic effect locally, (by decreasing the synthesis of inflammatory leukotrienes and cytokines) prior to elimination in the faeces.<br />Therefore, 5-ASA and its derivatives are now usually preferred given alone (i.e. mesalazine), despite their increased cost, due to their more favourable effects.

The case presented is of a patient with ankylosing spondylosis. The diagnosis is clinical, with involvement of the sacroiliac joint as the earliest manifestation. The disease course is variable and may progress to a marked kyphosis of the spine. Other features include enthesitis (such as the Archilles tendon enthesitis in this case), costochondritis, peripheral joint involvement (usually asymmetrical and involving the large joints), aortic regurgitation, apical pulmonary fibrosis and amyloidosis. The ESR and CRP are usually raised. Initial x-rays may be unremarkable. However, later in the disease, syndesmophytes (bony spurs due to inflammatory enthesitis) may be seen between vertebrae resulting in the characteristic bamboo spine appearance. Ankylosing spondylosis is managed with exercises, not bed rest. NSAIDs are given, unless there are contraindications, for the management of pain. Therefore, NSAID and spinal exercises (A) is the correct answer and NSAID and bed rest (B) and bed rest (E) are incorrect. Local steroid injections may be used for pain relief, particularly for peripheral arthritis and enthesitis. However, oral prednisolone (C) is not normally used. Methotrexate and sulfasalazine (D) may be given to patients with peripheral arthritis, but do not help the back pain, making this answer incorrect.</p>","case 14"

It is important to note that the mineralization of the bone is normal. This loss of bone mass means there is an increasing likelihood of fracture with increasing age. Due to the accelerated loss of bone mass following the menopause, elderly women are at a higher risk of osteoporosis than men. There are numerous risk factors for the development of osteoporosis. Among them are Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups, female sex, increasing age, early menopause, smoking, excess alcohol, corticosteroid use, hypogonadism and rheumatoid arthritis. The reduced bone mass of osteoporosis may result in vertebral crush fractures, the majority of which are asymptomatic. The extent of osteoporosis is best investigated with a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan (E). This gives a T score, which is the number of standard deviations the patient&rsquo;s bone mineral density differs from the population average for a young healthy adult. The World Health Organization defines osteoporosis as a T score of &minus;2.5 or greater (i.e. the bone mineral density of more than 2.5 standard deviations below that of the average for a young healthy adult).

Preventative measures include sterilising instruments and disinfecting surfaces.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Droplets:&nbsp;</strong>via coughing or sneezing (large droplets can be projected as far as 1m).

It is a yellow pigment that is responsible for the yellow sclera and mouth mucosa and also the yellowness of bruises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When old red cells pass through the spleen, macrophages break down the heme into unconjugated bilirubin (which is not water soluble). The unconjugated bilirubin is then sent to the liver, which conjugates it with glucuronic acid, making it soluble in water. Most of this conjugated bilirubin goes into the bile and out into the small intestine. (<em>some of the conjugated bilirubin remains in the large intestine and is metabolized into urobilinogen, then sterobilinogen, which gives the feces its brown color.</em>)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So: if you have an increase in serum bilirubin, it could be either because you&rsquo;re making too much bilirubin (usually due to an increase in red cell breakdown) or because you are having a hard time properly removing bilirubin from the system (either your bile ducts are blocked, or there is a liver problem, like cirrhosis, hepatitis, or an inherited problem with bilirubin processing).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The lab report shows that the total bilirubin, and also the percent that is conjugated vs. unconjugated. If you have a lot of bilirubin around and it is mostly unconjugated, that means that it hasn&rsquo;t been through the liver yet &ndash; so either you&rsquo;ve got a situation where you&rsquo;e got a ton of heme being broken down (and it&rsquo;s exceeding the pace of liver conjugation), or there&rsquo;s something wrong with the conjugating capacity of the liver (like a congenital disorder where you&rsquo;re missing an enzyme necessary for conjugation &ndash; for example, Gilbert syndrome).

In contrast, 20% of people with type 2 diabetes have retinopathy at diagnosis. Retinopathy is frequently asymptomatic in its earliest stages.</p><p>The most likely explanation for the blurred vision is a change in osmotic pressure in the eye as a result of correction of the hyperglycaemia. Prior to treatment glucose equilibrates between the eye and blood. When the glucose is lowered in the blood, this sets up an osmotic gradient between the eye and the blood. Water flows down the osmotic gradient. This leads to swelling of the eye and in particular the lens, resulting in a refractory defect.</p><p>With time, the glucose concentration in the eye falls and the refractory defect corrects itself. From a clinical perspective, it is important to warn patients about this phenomenon to prevent their understandable anxiety and also to advise them not to replace their glasses during this period as their eye prescription will undoubtedly change as the glucose comes under control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AW</p>","Case 17, case 10, Ophthalmology, Diabetes, Diabetic Retinopathy"

KCNJ11 and ABCC8 cause neonatal diabetes. These two genes can cause some rare forms of MODY and play a really important role in the physiology of a &beta;-cell. KCNJ11 makes the channel itself and ABCC8 forms a molecule which regulates the channel. Glucose comes into the cell, is phosphorylated and enters glycolysis and should increase ATP. ATP then binds to the SUR1 and closes the channel causing K+ to build up, the cell to depolarise and insulin to be released. If you have mutations in SUR1 it stops sensing ATP then the channel won&rsquo;t close. The channel wants to close because if it closes potassium levels start rising, the cell depolarises and insulin is released into the blood stream. Mutations in the potassium channel stop the cell from depolarising. These patients are perfectly capable of producing insulin, they just can&rsquo;t secrete it. Sulfonylureas prompts the channel to close.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This content is from the Genetics and Type 2 Diabetes Plenary</p>","diabetes, Genetics, Case 17"

During this conversion, one molecule each of NADH and FADH2 is formed, both of which enter the electron transport chain to form ATP (2 from FADH2 and 3 from NADH). Therefore, we can say that 5 molecules of ATP are generated in beta-oxidation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the liver mitochondria, acetyl-CoA has 2 pathways it can go into:</p><p><strong>1) Under normal conditions,&nbsp;</strong>the acetyl-CoA would enter the Krebs cycle to get more ATP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2)&nbsp;</strong>However, <strong>in states of starvation</strong>, it does no enter the Krebs cycle, as it must condense with oxaloacetate to make citrate. However, there is no oxaloacetate in the liver mitochondria when starving. This is because in starvation, oxaloacetate exits the mitochondria, goes into the cytoplasm and enters the gluconeogenesis pathway instead. Therefore, acetyl-CoA accumulates because it can't enter the Krebs cycle, and there it is all channeled into ketone body formation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The acetyl-CoA, still in the mitochondrial matrix of the liver, is converted to HMG-CoA by HMG-CoA synthase, which is then converted to <strong>acetoacetate</strong>&nbsp;(1/3), under the action of HMG-CoA lyase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Acetoacetate is inherently unstable, therefore the body puts an electron from NAD onto it to form <strong>B-hydroxybutyrate&nbsp;</strong>(2/3)&nbsp;(aka 3-hydroxybutyrate).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What can also happen to the unstable acetoacetate, a carboxyl group can be removed from the molecule, therefore decarboxylating it, to form&nbsp;<strong>acetone</strong> (3/3).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the three ketone bodies that move from the hepatocytes to the blood are; acetoacetate, B-hydroxybutyrate and acetone (note that acetone cannot be used as a fuel, it is diagnostically used by its distinct pear-drop smell).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All of the acetoacetate and B-hydroxybutyrate enter the extrahepatic cells from the blood (mainly muscle, renal cortex and brain in prolonged fasting). The B-hydroxybutyrate is reconverted BACK to acetoacetate by removing an electron to form NADH.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The acetoacetate is then activated by an enzyme called&nbsp;<strong>Thiophorase&nbsp;</strong>(which is not found in the liver), to form acetoacetyl-CoA. This molecule is then cleaved in the mitochondria to form 2 molecules of acetyl CoA, which then condenses with oxaloacetate to form citrate&nbsp;&rarr; Krebs cycle&nbsp;&rarr; generates ATP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TLDR; ketones are made from fatty acids.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Case10, Biochemistry"

It is more common in women than men (~75% of cases occurring in women) and may occur in young and healthy patients as well as those suffering chronic heart disease.&nbsp;Patients will typically complain of the sudden onset of rapid, regular palpitations. The patient may experience a brief fall in blood pressure causing presyncope or occasionally syncope.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An ECG for AVNRT will be rapid, but have normal QRS complexes, followed immediately by P waves (this is because the atria are excited in a retrograde manner, and the reentrant circuit is show).

By the time this impulse in the slow pathway reaches the end of the AVN, the refractory period of the fast pathway is over, and so it can enter the fast pathway distally and the impulse can go round and round in an AVN reentry circuit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Cardiology, Case 13"

One reason for this is that elastin, the principal load-bearing protein present in the wall of the aorta, is reduced in the abdominal aorta as compared to the thoracic aorta. Another is that the abdominal aorta does not possess vasa vasorum, the nutrient-supplying blood vessels within the wall of the aorta. Most AAA are true aneurysms that involve all three layers (tunica intima, tunica media and tunica adventitia). The prevalence of AAAs increases with age, with an average age of 65&ndash;70 at the time of diagnosis. AAAs have been attributed to atherosclerosis, though other factors are involved in their formation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before rupture, an AAA may present as a large, expansile mass above the umbilicus. A bruit may be heard from the turbulent flow in the aneurysm. Unfortunately, however, rupture may be the first hint of AAA.

So you can see the head end is considerably longer than the tail end. And forming in the midline of the epiblast is a groove called the&nbsp;<strong>primitive streak</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In week 3, the cells of the epiblast, from the right and left side, migrate towards the midline, primitive streak. When they get to the midline, they turn and go inwards and descend towards the hypoblast beneath it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the cells of the epiblast migrate through the primitive streak and all the way down to where the hypoblast cells are, they invaginate that layer and start to occupy it. As more and more of epiblastic cells do this, they displace the hypoblast cells which eventually die.

One such substance is &nbsp;the Shh protein, which induces formation of the floor plate of the neural tube.</p><p>The notochord also induces ectodermal cells over it to form the neural plate. The lateral edges of the neural plate become more elevated and form a neural fold with a depressed midregion called the neural groove. The neural folds come together and fuse to form the neural tube, which later forms the brain and spinal cord.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note that neural tube defects are caused by arrest of normal development and closure of the neural tube, resulting in conditions such as spina bifida or anencephaly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>----</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So now that we have a flat 3 layered embryo, we need it to become 3D. Think of three papers all on top of each other, top paper is ectoderm, middle paper is mesoderm and the paper at the bottom is the endoderm. To make it a round 3 layered embryo, we need to fold it (4 weeks). Therefore, the edge on the left and right meet and fuse at the midline to form a tube. Once the tube is formed, the outer layer is ectoderm, middle layer is mesoderm and inner layer of endoderm, with the tube opened at front and back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, we know the inner endoderm forms the lining of the gut tube, so one open end is for the mouth and the other is for the anus. The outer layer is the ectoderm, which we know forms the surface of the body, skin. And everything in between is mesoderm, which gives rise to cartilage, bone, muscle, connective tissue, blood etc. Which is in fact what we find between the surface of the body and the lining of the gut tube.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""http://images.slideplayer.com/14/4343420/slides/slide_8.jpg"" alt="""" width=""589"" height=""442"" /></p><p>What happens when the lateral body folds fail to fuse properly? You end up with a gap in the ventral body wall. This can allow structures that should be inside the embryo to escape and end up in the amniotic cavity. One such problem is gastroschisis, where abdominal viscera exits through a defect in the abdominal wall and is found in the amniotic cavity.

Thus to calculate the total probability you supply multiple all the accumulative probabilities for both possibilities.

One patient, Mrs Nkem Obande, a 65 year old lady, complains that her medication is causing her to have headaches. You ask the nurse about this drug and she tells you that it works by inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP-4), thus inhibiting the inactivation of GLP-1.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What drug is the patient most likely taking?</p>","<p>Metformin</p>","<p>Sitagliptin</p>","<p>Exenatide</p>","<p>Pioglitazone</p>","<p>Gliplizide</p>","<p>The mechanism of the drug described in the question correlates with&nbsp;<strong>sitagliptin</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sitaglipin is one of two agents which affect GLP-1. GLP-1 and GIP are incretin hormones, both secreted by endocrine cells that are located in the epithelium of the small intestine. An increase of substances in the lumen of the GI tract (like glucose) triggers the secretion of these hormones. Incretins are carried through the circulation to target tissues: pancreatic beta cells. The incretin stimulation of beta cells causes them to secrete&nbsp;<strong>more</strong> insulin in response to the same amount of glucose.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>GLP-1 is inactivated by an enzyme called&nbsp;<strong>dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP-4)</strong>. This enzyme breaks down the incretin. Sitagliptin works by inhibiting DPP-4 and thus preventing GLP-1 from being inactivated, so more GLP-1 in the circulation allows for an increase in insulin release, decrease in glucagon release and thus an overall&nbsp;<em>decrease</em>&nbsp;in blood glucose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The main side effect of DPP-4 inhibitors is&nbsp;<strong>headaches</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Exenatide</strong> is the other drug that works on GLP-1. It is a long-acting GLP-1 receptor full agonist used in type 2 DM in a combination with other agents.

The rise in ATP is detected by the sulfonylurea receptor subunit (SUR-1) of the K+ATPase channel and causes it to close. This increases the K+ inside the cell which depolarises the membrane, leading to opening of Ca2+ channels. Calcium influx into the cell causes insulin to be released from granules. Sulfonylureas bypass all of this and and bind to SUR-1 thus blocking the K+ channels, causing insulin release.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A common side effect of sulfonylureas is hypoglycaemia, and a more severe side effect is cholestasis (where bile cannot flow from the liver to the duodenum).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=""https://sheerazgul.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/20131227-013551.jpg"" alt="""" width=""370"" height=""311"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly,&nbsp;<strong>acarbose</strong> (not one of the options, but i've gotten this far explaining them all so might as well carry on!) works by inhibiting&nbsp;<strong>a-glucosidase</strong> in the brush borders of the small intestine.

Intrinsic factor is responsible for assisting absorption of vitamin B12 found in proteinaceous foods such as meat, fish and eggs.

Here's why:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The 1st hint&nbsp;was the inability to evert the foot. The&nbsp;muscles responsible for foot eversion are: Fibularis longus and&nbsp;Fibularis brevis. These two muscles are supplied by the superficial fibular nerve. At this point you might be thinking <em>""Hold on! What about Fibularis tertius?!""</em> Well fibularis tertius only <strong>aids</strong> in the everting of the foot. It's primary function is ankle dorsiflexion (it's supplied by deep fibular nerve).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The 2nd hint is the loss of sensation. So&nbsp;it says&nbsp;he&nbsp;lost sensation&nbsp;over the dorsum of&nbsp;his left&nbsp;foot with the exception of the lateral side of the fifth digit&nbsp;and the first interdigital cleft. The first interdigital cleft&nbsp;is supplied by the deep fibular nerve and the lateral side of the fifth digit is supplied by the sural nerve. The rest (i.e. majority of dosrum surface) is supplied by the superficial fibular nerve, so here again you should be thinking <em>""something's wrong with the superficial nerve.""</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;(this link shows you the foot dermatomes, in case you're a bit lost: <a class=""enteredLink"" href=""http://www.frca.co.uk/images/lowerlimb-fig8-small.jpg"" target=""_blank"">http://www.frca.co.uk/images/lowerlimb-fig8-small.jpg</a>)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now you can look back at the fact that his fracture is located at the midshaft of his fibula; what runs&nbsp;close along&nbsp;it there? The superficial fibular nerve!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here's another link that&nbsp;talks a bit about&nbsp;superficial fibular nerve and potential&nbsp;damage: <a class=""enteredLink"" href=""http://teachmeanatomy.info/lower-limb/nerves/superficial-fibular-nerve/"" target=""_blank"">http://teachmeanatomy.info/lower-limb/nerves/superficial-fibular-nerve/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another way of working this out is by ruling out answers:</p><p>1) The medial plantar, is a the larger branch of the&nbsp;tibial nerve, while the later plantar is the smaller branch.&nbsp;they both supply the skin of the plantar surface of the foot. Just look at their name: medial <strong>plantar</strong>, lateral <strong>plantar</strong>. The patient however suffers from loss of sensation on the dorsal surface!</p><p>2) As for the Saphenous nerve, it supplies the skin on the medial side of the foot as far as the head of the first metatarsal. It has no contribution to foot eversion. So it can't be this nerve.</p><p>3) Deep Fibular nerve doesn't contribute to foot eversion, but dorsiflexion and extension of the toes. It also supplies the skin at the first interdigital cleft,&nbsp;an area that&nbsp;the patient hasn't lost sensation in. So again it can't be this nerve.</p><p>&nbsp;This leaves us with superficial fibular nerve as the only answer :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>*Additional info:</p><p>Something you might find interesting is that the deep fibular nerve injury causes a foot drop!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Foot, Anatomy, Innervation, Innervations, Lower Limb"

It is usually mild in children but there is a risk of serious complications, such as bacterial pneumonia.</p><p>Note the reddest pox just above his belly button, you can see they're shiny and just about to ooze.&nbsp;</p><p>Chickenpox appears as a very itchy rash that spreads from the torso to the neck, face and limbs. Lasting seven to 10 days, the rash progresses from red bumps to fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) that drain and scab over and drop off. Vesicles may also appear in the mouth, on the scalp, around the eyes or on the genitals and can be very painful. The initial infection generally starts as a fever, followed by cold symptoms and the rash.</p><p>This cycle repeats itself in new areas of the body until finally, after about two weeks, all of the sores have healed. The disease is contagious until all the spots have dried up. Unfortunately, the virus is also contagious for at least one day before the rash breaks out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>http://www.medicinenet.com/skin_pictures_child_pictures_slideshow/article.htm</p><p>This link is has a really good summary and some pictures of common rashes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Heat Rash ('Prickly Heat'):<br />Young babies often get heat rash. Blocked sweat glands cause heat rash, which results in a red pimply eruption on the head and neck. It's important to dress your infant appropriately (not too hot and not too cold) to prevent the eruption. Generally, heat rash resolves on its own.</p><p>Impetigo:</p><p>Impetigo can be confused with other skin infections, including cellulitis (a deeper infection) and even ringworm. Common bacteria found on the skin cause impetigo, and antibiotics easily treat impetigo. The rash itself looks oozy, blistery, and red initially and then may develop a yellowish crust. It spreads by contact, and scratching makes it worse. Impetigo can occur anywhere on the body, but it's commonly found around the mouth and nose.</p><p>Molluscum contagiosum (MC):</p><p>MC is a viral infection that affects the skin. It most commonly affects children, although it can occur at any age.<br />Usually, the only symptom of MC is a number of small, firm, raised papules (spots) that develop on the skin. They are not painful, but can be itchy.<br />Although the spots can look unpleasant, MC is generally a harmless condition that will normally resolve in a few months without any specific treatment.</p><p>Utricaria (hives):</p><p>Hives are the result of an allergic reaction. They appear as small red itchy bumps or welts, which may be painful as well. Exposure to an allergen, such as a food or medicine, may cause hives. Some common allergies include nuts, eggs, and shellfish, but certain viruses can also cause hives. Although hives alone are not dangerous, if your child develops breathing troubles, including cough and wheezing along with the hives, it might signal a more serious allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention. Antihistamines are the standard treatment for hives.</p><p>Here is a really great algorithm for diagnosing rashes from Patient.co.uk, below I have defined some of the terms used in the algorithm:</p><p><img src=""http://medical.cdn.patient.co.uk/images/rash2.png"" alt="""" width=""825"" height=""614"" />&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Papular</strong> =&nbsp;A papule is a circumscribed, solid elevation of skin with no visible fluid, varying in size from a pinhead to 1 cm. They can be brown, purple, pink or red in color, and can cluster into a papular rash</p><p><strong>Blanch/Blanching rash</strong> = will disappear when you press on it</p><p><strong>Pustule: </strong>A pustule is a small collection of pus in the top layer of skin (epidermis) or beneath it in the dermis. Pustules frequently form in sweat glands or hair follicles. Pus is a mixture of inflammatory cells and liquid</p><p><strong>Vesiculobullous rash:&nbsp;</strong>A vesiculobullous disease is a type of mucocutaneous disease that is characterized by vesicles and bullae (i.e. blisters). Both vesicles and bullae are fluid-filled lesions, and they are distinguished by size (vesicles being less than 5-10 mm and bulla being larger than 5-10 mm, depending upon what definition is used).</p><p>A <strong>papulosquamous</strong> disorder is a condition which presents with both papules and scales, or both scaly papules and plaques. Examples include psoriasis, lichen planus, and pityriasis rosea.</p><p><strong>Purpuric</strong>:&nbsp;purplish discoloration of the skin produced by small bleeding vessels near the surface.</p>","Case 9, Rashes"

This results from either ingestion of poorly absorbed substrate, or malabsorption of a substrate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer is <strong>B - secretory diarrhoea.</strong></p><p>Large volumes of water are normally secreted into the small intestinal lumen, but a large majority of this water is efficienty absorbed before reaching the large intestine. Diarrhea occurs when secretion of water into the intestinal lumen exceeds absorption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many millions of people have died of the secretory diarrhea associated with cholera. The responsible organism, Vibrio cholerae, produces cholera toxin, which strongly activates adenylyl cyclase, causing a prolonged increase in intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP within crypt enterocytes. This change results in prolonged opening of the chloride channels that are instrumental in secretion of water from the crypts, allowing uncontrolled secretion of water. Additionally, cholera toxin affects the enteric nervous system, resulting in an independent stimulus of secretion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>C - Infectious/inflammatory diarrhoea - </strong>Not caused by cholera. Disruption of the epithelium of the intestine due to microbial or viral pathogens is a very common cause of diarrhea in all species. Destruction of the epithelium results not only in exudation of serum and blood into the lumen but often is associated with widespread destruction of absorptive epithelium. In such cases, absorption of water occurs very inefficiently and diarrhea results. Examples of such infections come from E.coli, Campylobacter, and rotavirus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>D Immotility diarrhoea - </strong>Not caused by cholera.

It is responsible for controlling circadian rhythms. The neuronal and hormonal activities it generates regulate many different body functions in a 24-hour cycle, using around 20,000 neurons.&nbsp;The SCN interacts with many other regions of the brain. It contains several cell types and several different peptides (including vasopressin and vasoactive intestinal peptide) and neurotransmitters.</p><p><img src=""http://archiv.skoropsycho.cz/obrazky/archiv.skoropsycho.cz/supr.jpg"" alt="""" width=""558"" height=""374"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>amygdala&nbsp;</strong>are two almond-shaped groups of nuclei located deep and medially within the temporal lobes of the brain in complex vertebrates, including humans.

It includes the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and several other nearby areas. It appears to be primarily responsible for our emotional life, and has a lot to do with the formation of memories. In this drawing, you are looking at the brain cut in half, but with the brain stem intact. The part of the limbic system shown is that which is along the left side of the thalamus (hippocampus and amygdala) and just under the front of the thalamus (hypothalamus)</p><p><img src=""http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/limbicsystem.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""320"" /></p><p>The <strong>caudate nucleus</strong> plays a vital role in how the brain learns, specifically the storing and processing of memories.

They are also situated near the thalamus, which is deep in the brain, close to the midbrain.</p><p><img src=""http://www.lilyandbeyond.org/_/rsrc/1403477322950/home/apply-online/activation-suite/caudate-nucleus/Parkinsons2.png?height=312&amp;width=400"" alt="""" width=""400"" height=""312"" /></p><p><strong>See this link for 3D views of brain structures:</strong>&nbsp;http://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/caudate-nucleus</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nucleus accumbens</strong>:&nbsp;is a region in the basal forebrain rostral to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus.

It plays a lesser role in fear, impulsivity, and the placebo effect.

It produces melatonin, a serotonin derived hormone, which affects the modulation of sleep patterns in both seasonal and circadian rhythms. Its shape resembles a tiny pine cone (hence its name), and it is located in the epithalamus, near the center of the brain, between the two hemispheres, tucked in a groove where the two halves of the thalamus join. (<em>See first diagram for location)</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>More info on the hypothalamus:</em></p><p>The hypothalamus is a small part of the brain located just below the thalamus on both sides of the third ventricle. (The ventricles are areas within the cerebrum that are filled with cerebrospinal fluid, and connect to the fluid in the spine.) It sits just inside the two tracts of the optic nerve, and just above (and intimately connected with) the pituitary gland.</p><p>The hypothalamus is one of the busiest parts of the brain, and is mainly concerned with homeostasis. Homeostasis is the process of returning something to some &ldquo;set point.&rdquo; It works like a thermostat: When your room gets too cold, the thermostat conveys that information to the furnace and turns it on. As your room warms up and the temperature gets beyond a certain point, it sends a signal that tells the furnace to turn off.</p><p>The hypothalamus is responsible for regulating your hunger, thirst, response to pain, levels of pleasure, sexual satisfaction, anger and aggressive behavior, and more. It also regulates the functioning of the autonomic nervous system (see below), which in turn means it regulates things like pulse, blood pressure, breathing, and arousal in response to emotional circumstances.</p><p>The hypothalamus receives inputs from a number of sources. From the vagus nerve, it gets information about blood pressure and the distension of the gut (that is, how full your stomach is). From the reticular formation in the brainstem, it gets information about skin temperature. From the optic nerve, it gets information about light and darkness. From unusual neurons lining the ventricles, it gets information about the contents of the cerebrospinal fluid, including toxins that lead to vomiting. And from the other parts of the limbic system and the olfactory (smell) nerves, it gets information that helps regulate eating and sexuality. The hypothalamus also has some receptors of its own, that provide information about ion balance and temperature of the blood.</p><p>In one of the more recent discoveries, it seems that there is a protein called leptin which is released by fat cells when we overeat. The hypothalamus apparently senses the levels of leptin in the bloodstream and responds by decreasing appetite. It would seem that some people have a mutation in a gene which produces leptin, and their bodies can&rsquo;t tell the hypothalamus that they have had enough to eat. However, many overweight people do not have this mutation, so there is still a lot of research to do!</p><p>The hypothalamus sends instructions to the rest of the body in two ways. The first is to the autonomic nervous system. This allows the hypothalamus to have ultimate control of things like blood pressure, heartrate, breathing, digestion, sweating, and all the sympathetic and parasympathetic functions.</p><p>The other way the hypothalamus controls things is via the pituitary gland. It is neurally and chemically connected to the pituitary, which in turn pumps hormones called releasing factors into the bloodstream. As you know, the pituitary is the so-called &ldquo;master gland,&rdquo; and these hormones are vitally important in regulating growth and metabolism.</p><p>http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/limbicsystem.html</p>","Sleep, Endocrine, Case 12, Physiology, Head and Neck"

Gastrin then stimulates the secretion of both intrinsic factor and hydrochloric acid from parietal cells. The hydrochloric acid catalyses the conversion of pesinogen to pepsin. The acidic environment created and pepsin are both important for the hydrolysis of proteins. Intrinsic factor is responsible for assisting absorption of vitamin B12 found in proteinaceous foods such as meat, fish and eggs. D cells (found in the antrum of the stomach) are stimulated by Gastrin and secrete somatostatin, a hormone which inhibits Gastrin excretion from G cells and hydrochloric acid from parietal cells (a negative feedback mechanism presenting the stomach becoming too acidic).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Leydig cells are testosterone producing cells found in the testicles.

As a 17 year old, he wanted to taste this 'freedom' that all his cool, driving test passing friends are chatting about. So, he ventured out alone in his turbo-engined, tinted windowed Renault Clio (in metallic blue) for the first time on the big old dangerous roads. Brian's bad-ass and he didn't want to use the green p plates (who wants to declare to the world that they've just passed their test?- lame).&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian thought he'd better stick to the national speed limit of 60mph to gain the respect of others on the road. He took a scenic route where the roads were narrow and windy. He underestimated the bend ahead- silly Brian- so, he crashed. Yet another Renault Clio gone to waste (RIP). He was crying due to the shock of losing his Clio. He was also crying because he was in a lot of pain. It was determined that he had sustained a left brachial plexus injury. After initial recovery it was observed that &nbsp;his diaphragm functions normally, there was no winging of the scapula but abduction cannot be initiated. However, if the arm is helped through the first 45 degrees of abduction, Brian can fully abduct the arm. So where on earth has Brian injured his brachial plexus?</p>","<p>Axillary nerve</p>","<p>Posterior cord</p>","<p>Roots of the plexus</p>","<p>Superior Trunk</p>","<p>Suprascapular Nerve</p>","<p>Let's take the observations one by one to break down this question.</p><ul><li>If the diaphragm is functioning normally, you know that the phrenic nerve is probably uninjured, which means that the C5 root has not been damaged.</li><li>Since the scapula is not winged, there was no damage to the long thoracic nerve or the C5-7 nerve roots.</li><li>Since the patient cannot initiate abduction of the arm, you know that the suprascapular nerve is injured and supraspinatus has been denervated. But, the patient can abduct the arm once it is lifted to 45 degrees, so the deltoid muscle and the axillary nerve must be intact.</li></ul><p>Taking the answer choices one by one: The axillary nerve is ok, because deltoid is functioning. The posterior cord of the brachial plexus must also be intact, since this cord gives off the axillary nerve. The roots of the brachial plexus are ok, since the phrenic nerve and long thoracic nerve (which are derived from the roots) are still functioning. The superior trunk of the brachial plexus must also be undamaged, since this trunk contributes to the posterior cord which is intact. So, this means that the injury must be to the suprascapular nerve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Anatomy, Nerve innervation of upper limb, Anatomy of the upper limb, Upper limb"

So instead of decreasing the threshold at which an action potential can be triggered, the sympathetic system increases the voltage at which the funny channels can open. Therefore they open at a lesser level of hyperpolarisation to increase heart rate.</p>","PCS Unit2"

Here adrenaline (epinephrine) is released from the adrenal cortex in response to external stimuli. Here adrenaline is an example of endocrine signalling. Once the adrenaline reaches the target cells, which in this case is the muscle, it attaches to the adrenorecptor on the cell membrane, activating the G protein coupled receptor. G protein receptor will then activate adenylyl cyclase enzyme, which will bind with ATP to prodeuce cAMP + PPi (aka Pyrophosphate) The G protein acts as an intermediate between the receptor and the synthesis of cAMP. This increase in production of cAMP activates protein Kinase A. Protein kinase A then goes on to develop the cascade by activating or inactivatting certain enzymes, which causes the production of the product. In this particular case Protein kinase A inhibits glycogen synthetase but activates phosphorylase, by causing a confirmational change of the active site.

These two muscles are supplied by the superficial fibular nerve. At this point you might be thinking <em>""Hold on! What about Fibularis tertius?!""</em> Well fibularis tertius only <strong>aids</strong> in the everting of the foot. It's primary function is ankle dorsiflexion (it's supplied by deep fibular nerve).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The 2nd hint is the loss of sensation. So&nbsp;it says&nbsp;he&nbsp;lost sensation&nbsp;over the dorsum of&nbsp;his left&nbsp;foot with the exception of the lateral side of the fifth digit&nbsp;and the first interdigital cleft. The first interdigital cleft&nbsp;is supplied by the deep fibular nerve and the lateral side of the fifth digit is supplied by the sural nerve. The rest (i.e. majority of dosrum surface) is supplied by the superficial fibular nerve, so here again you should be thinking <em>""something's wrong with the superficial nerve.""</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;(this link shows you the foot dermatomes, in case you're a bit lost: <a class=""enteredLink"" href=""http://www.frca.co.uk/images/lowerlimb-fig8-small.jpg"" target=""_blank"">http://www.frca.co.uk/images/lowerlimb-fig8-small.jpg</a>)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now you can look back at the fact that his fracture is located at the midshaft of his fibula; what runs&nbsp;close along&nbsp;it there?

Just look at their name: medial <strong>plantar</strong>, lateral <strong>plantar</strong>. The patient however suffers from loss of sensation on the dorsal surface!</p><p>2) As for the Saphenous nerve, it supplies the skin on the medial side of the foot as far as the head of the first metatarsal. It has no contribution to foot eversion. So it can't be this nerve.</p><p>3) Deep Fibular nerve doesn't contribute to foot eversion, but dorsiflexion and extension of the toes. It also supplies the skin at the first interdigital cleft,&nbsp;an area that&nbsp;the patient hasn't lost sensation in. So again it can't be this nerve.</p><p>&nbsp;This leaves us with superficial fibular nerve as the only answer :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>*Additional info:</p><p>Something you might find interesting is that the deep fibular nerve injury causes a foot drop!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Foot, Anatomy, Innervation, Innervations, Lower Limb"

As a result, he or she will not be effectively protected after immunisation. Some students were not vaccinated at childhood or may have not had the booster The vaccine against mumps is effective but its not fail-safe (two doses are 88% effective) It is a very contagious disease In university you bring numerous people together from a wide geographic area in a small space One third of cases never show symptoms - the person who brought the illness may have never gone to the doctor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Primary vaccine failure is no seroconversion after vaccination(s) (which means no vaccine-specific antibody response) and secondary vaccine failure is loss of immunity after seroconversion (memory waning). Causes of primary vaccine failure can include poor clinical practices that may contribute to poor vaccine responses. Fastidious adherence to recommended storage and handling conditions is required. Interruption of cold chain can lead to significant reductions in potency and consequent reduction in immune response. For example, delay in use after reconstitution (&gt;30min) and exposure to light can inactivate the attenuated mumps virus. Primary and secondary vaccine failures may also relate to an individual&rsquo;s immune constitution-MHC and other genetic polymorphisms influencing the immune response.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Source: Powerpoint on Mumps from one of the tutorials in Case 9</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","case 9"

In ulcerative colitis the most commonly reported symptom is rectal bleeding. This is because the inflammation in UC mainly affects the colon and rectum. Crohn's typically exhibits rectal sparing so rectal bleeding is only reported in the minority of cases.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B - This is indicative of Crohn's. In UC there is diffuse continuous inflammation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>C- This is indicative of Crohn's. Crohn's disease can cause inflammation along the entire GI tract from mouth to rectum and will typically exhibit small bowel involvement. The most common sites for Crohn's are terminal ileum and colon. &nbsp;Whereas in UC the inflammation is just the colon and rectum. &nbsp;The inflammation can either just involve the rectum i.e. proctitis (1/3), go up to the splenic flexure (1/3) or involve the entire colon (1/3).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>D - This is indicative of Crohn's, it is not required for diagnosis but will confirm a diagnosis of Crohn's.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>E - This is indicative of Crohn's. Pneumaturia is passing gas when passing urine, which is a result of a enterovesicular fistula (the 2nd most common fistula). Fistulas are a feature of Crohn's because the inflammation of the bowel is transmural (goes through every layer) and hence can result in perforation and then the formation of passeges (fistualae) between abdominal/pelvic structures. Because UC only shows inflammation of the mucosal layer fistulae tend to not occur. Similarly a perianal lesion would be indicative of Crohn's not UC (except for rectovaginal fistula on a very rare occasion).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other distinguishing factors:</p><ul><li>Crohn's shows assymetrical involvement of the bowel walls vs UC shows symmetrical</li><li>P.gangrenosum is more commonly found in UC vs erythema nodulosum is more commonly seen in Crohn's.</li><li>Orofacial granulomatosis, aphthous somatitis, chilitis stomattis are specific to Crohn's.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>NB: Patient has asymmetrical colitic arthritis in his knee which is an extra-intestinal disease associated sign of IBD.&nbsp;</p>","Abdomen, case 11, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Lower GI"

Azathioprine is a prodrug that is converted into its active metabolite. This metabolite acts as a purine antagonist and interferes with nucleic acid synthesis in WBCs (esp. T lymphocytes) which are important cells in the production of pro-inflammatory mediators.

When the enterochromaffin cells release 5-HT it binds to these receptors which are GPCRs. This activate Gq protein which in turn activates PLC. PLC then cleaves PIP2 into IP3 and DAG. IP3 binds to its receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum resulting in the release of calcium. The calcium bind to calmodulin and this forms a calcoum-calmodulin complex. The complex binds to and activates CaM-kinase. CaM kinase then phosphorylates chloride channels in the apical membrane of the enterocytes allowing them to open. The chloride is then secreted into the lumen of the GI tract. This lowers the water potential in the lumen and results in the movement of water down the osmotic gradient into the GI lumen, making the stools more watery and hence causing diarrhoea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The use of SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs will result in prevent 5-HT reuptake --&gt; increased 5-HT which means there is more 5-HT to bind to the receptors in the enterocyte membrane causing increased Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Which anti-depressant is least likely to be used?</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Fluoxetine and Citalopram are SSRIs therefore will cause diarrhoea.</li><li>Amitriptyline is a TCA &nbsp;therefore will cause diarrhoea.</li><li>Duloxetine is an SNRI therefore will cause diarrhoea.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Buproprion is an atypical anti-depressant which blocks the reuptake of dopamine and noradrenalin.

Together with the cochlea, a part of the auditory system, it constitutes the labyrinth of the inner ear in most mammals. As movements consist of rotations and translations, the vestibular system comprises two components: the semicircular canals, which indicate rotational movements; and the otoliths, which indicate linear accelerations. The vestibular system sends signals primarily to the neural structures that control eye movements, and to the muscles that keep an animal upright. The projections to the former provide the anatomical basis of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which is required for clear vision; and the projections to the muscles that control posture are necessary to keep an animal upright.

Stimulation is indirect since osteoclasts do not have a receptor for PTH; rather, PTH binds to osteoblasts, the cells responsible for creating bone. Binding stimulates osteoblasts to increase their expression of RANKL and inhibits their secretion of Osteoprotegerin (OPG). Free OPG competitively binds to RANKL as a decoy receptor, preventing RANKL from interacting with RANK, a receptor for RANKL. The binding of RANKL to RANK (facilitated by the decreased amount of OPG available for binding the excess RANKL) stimulates these osteoclast precursors to fuse, forming new osteoclasts, which ultimately enhances bone resorption.</p><p>Basically I think main point is PTH binds to osteoloasts which INDIRECTLY stimulates osteoclasts</p>","Bone, case 14"

This hypothesis is supported by the following facts:</p><ul><li>50% Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome pts suffer from depression</li><li>50% pts with moderate to severe depression show &uarr; cortisol</li><li>We fail to supress cortisol when dexamethasone (an exogenous corticosteroid) is given&nbsp;to depressed patients</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>C = There is loss of neuronal communication due to damage or death of the neurones in the networks. Aspects of the description do discuss neuronal neworking but there are added bits about CRH that should make you pick B. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>D = &nbsp;a deficiency of monoamines <strong>AND</strong> impaired function/interactions of other chemicals in the brain such as&nbsp;other classes of neurotransmitters (e.g. glutamate) and secondary messengers (e.g. calcium, cytokines, proteins, lithium) For example, it has been found that pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL6 and TNF-alpha activate the HPA axis and impair the central serotonin system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>E =&nbsp;Neural plasticity may be defined as the ability of neurons and neural elements to adapt in response to intrinsic and extrinsic signals. As such, our ability to process and synthesise information, ultimately producing behaviour, is dependent upon this neural plasticity. Dysregulation or disruption of neural plasticity is associated with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease. Neuroplasticity is initiated by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. So changes in glutamate neurotransmission can affect how well the neurones can adapt. Stress and genetic vulnerability causes overactive glucocorticoids mediated by glutamate&rarr; cellular atrophy and then lead to depression. Again, the description in the question does talk about neuronal plasticity and overactive corticoids but there is no mention of glutamate in the question stem so I would pick B over E because glutamate is a big part of the neural plasticity hypothesis.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A final hypothesis not mentioned is the immune dysfunction hypothesis.

It is commonly diagnosed by stool microscopy (trophozoites may be seen in fresh stool, and iodine staining reveals the cyst form of the protozoan in stool).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The appropriate course of treatment is metronidazole, which has efficacy of 80-95%.</p><p>Supportive management (Option A) is appropriate in most cases of bacterial IID, unless severe.</p><p>Ciprofloxacin (Option C) can be used in treatment of severe infection by some types of E. Coli (EPEC, EIEC)</p><p>Aggressive rehydration &nbsp;(Option D) is often needed in cholera infection, which causes profuse, highly watery stool and therefore large loss of fluids.</p><p>Probiotics (Option E) are a treatment option for Clostridium Difficile infection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Gastroenterology, Gastrointestinal System, case 11, Infection, Infectious Disease"

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are circulating dendritic cells, present in plasma, and are especially imortant in response to viraemia (virus present in the blood). They express TLR-7 (recognises viral RNA) and TLR-9 (recognises viral DNA) and produce 1000x more interferon-alpha compared to other cell types. Type I interferons (alpha and beta) are important in response to viral infections since they induce an ""anti-viral"" state in cells (i.e. expression of genes that increase resistance to viral entry and replication and modification of cell metabolism to create a hostile environment for viruses).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Option A describes the function of conventional dendritic cells, which are resident sentinel cells in tissues and are part of the immediate innate immune response. They also act as a ""bridge"" between innate and adaptive immunity, since they are capable of migrating to the closest draining lymph node and presenting antigen molecules to naive T cells via MHC-II.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Options B and C describe a functions of NK cells. NK cells express a large number of receptors, which can be activatory or inhibitory. If an activatory receptor detects a change on the surface of the cell which means the cell is infected, it activates the NK cell to induce caspase-mediated apoptosis of the infected cell. NK cells and macrophages collaborate and activate each other: macrophages can secrete IL-12, which activates NK cells. NK cells, in turn, can secrete IFN-gamma, which enhances the macrophages' phagocytic function.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Option E is incorrect: the classical pathway of complement activation is initiated in response to Ig binding to pathogens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Source: Case 9, Immunological Response to Viral Infection plenary.</p>","case 9, Infection, immunology, Innate Immune System, Innate immunity"

In meiosis, the pairs of chromosomes are supposed to split up and go to different spots in the dividing cell; this event is called ""disjunction."" However, occasionally one pair doesn't divide, and the whole pair goes to one spot. This means that in the resulting cells, one will have 24 chromosomes and the other will have 22 chromosomes. This accident is called ""nondisjunction."" If a sperm or egg with an abnormal number of chromosomes merges with a normal mate, the resulting fertilized egg will have an abnormal number of chromosomes. In Down syndrome, <strong>95% of all cases are caused by this event</strong>: one cell has two 21st chromosomes instead of one, so the resulting fertilized egg has three 21st chromosomes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Recent research has shown that in these cases, approximately 90% of the abnormal cells are the eggs. The cause of the nondisjunction error isn't known, but there is definitely connection with maternal age. Research is currently aimed at trying to determine the cause and timing of the nondisjunction event.</p><p><br />Three to four percent of all cases of trisomy 21 are due to Robertsonian Translocation. In this case, two breaks occur in separate chromosomes, usually the 14th and 21st chromosomes. There is rearrangement of the genetic material so that some of the 14th chromosome is replaced by extra 21st chromosome. So while the number of chromosomes remain normal, there is a triplication of the 21st chromosome material. Some of these children may only have triplication of part of the 21st chromosome instead of the whole chromosome, which is called a partial trisomy 21. Translocations resulting in trisomy 21 may be inherited, so it's important to check the chromosomes of the parents in these cases to see if either may be a ""carrier.""</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The remainder of cases of trisomy 21 are due to mosaicism. These people have a mixture of cell lines, some of which have a normal set of chromosomes and others which have trisomy 21. In cellular mosaicism, the mixture is seen in different cells of the same type. In tissue mosaicism, one set of cells, such as all blood cells, may have normal chromosomes, and another type, such as all skin cells, may have trisomy 21.</p>","Pretend Exam, Case 7"

Whilst drinking a shake after a massive session of squats in the gym, he contemplates the process of digestion. He recalls that one of the enzymes involved in protein digestion (a proteolytic enzyme) in the stomach is pepsin and it's inactive precursor (zymogen) is pepsinogen. But he can't remember which cells in the stomach secrete pepsinogen. He asks a fellow medical student who knows everything as she uses PeerWise everyday.</p><p>Which cells does she tell him are responsible?</p>","<p>chief cells</p>","<p>d cells</p>","<p>g cells</p>","<p>leydig cells</p>","<p>parietal cells</p>","<p>Chief cells (found in the body of the stomach) are responsible for secretion of pepsinogen, which is converted into the active proteolytic enzyme pepsin.</p><p>Consumption of protein stimulates the production of gastrin, secreted by G cells. Gastrin then stimulates the secretion of both intrinsic factor and hydrochloric acid from parietal cells. The hydrochloric acid catalyses the conversion of pesinogen to pepsin. The acidic environment created and pepsin are both important for the hydrolysis of proteins. Intrinsic factor is responsible for assisting absorption of vitamin B12 found in proteinaceous foods such as meat, fish and eggs. D cells (found in the antrum of the stomach) are stimulated by Gastrin and secrete somatostatin, a hormone which inhibits Gastrin excretion from G cells and hydrochloric acid from parietal cells (a negative feedback mechanism presenting the stomach becoming too acidic).</p><p>Leydig cells are testosterone producing cells found in the testicles. They are important for getting buff but have little direct influence on digestion.</p><p>Random mnemonic: I remember that chief cells secrete pepsinogen and are found in the body of the stomach by picturing the image of a native American chief drinking pepsi, which goes into his body.</p><p>Pepsi is the ancient Greek word for digestion.</p><p>Apparently the drink ""Pepsi"" is so named as it was initially marketed as a digestive aid (although the sources for this are dubious), other dubious sources claim that Pepsi is called Pepsi because Pepsin is involved or was involved in it's production (again, this is from dodgy internet sources, not necessarily true).

Vit A - retinol,</strong> don't want too much of this in pregnancy!

Deficiencyy leads to a macrocytic anaemia (too big! MCV too big!)<br /><br /><strong>D. B12</strong>, Co-albumin. IMPORTANT: Remember that its bound to R-proteins in the saliva to protect it from stomach acid, NOT INTRINSIC FACTOR (thats in the stomach, from P cells). deficiency causes a macrocytic anaemia too, and neuropathy, and also mouth symptoms such as a BEEFY RED TONGUE. Deficiency is called pernicious anaemia.<br /><br /><strong>E. Vitamin D!</strong> Deficiency leads to osteomalacia, which if you were doing Case 14 would have low Ca2+, but increased PTH on serum checks (probably high alk phos and low P too). <br /><img src=""http://www.ikonet.com/en/visualdictionary/images/nutrients-vitamins.jpg"" alt="""" width=""856"" height=""965"" /><br /><br />Only other things to note I think are:<br /><strong>Vitamin K </strong>important for clotting factors 2,7,9,10, you lose these when you take warfarin. so if you've got Vit K deficiency you'll have coagulation problems<br /><strong>B3 Niacin</strong> deficiency causes PELLEGRA - 3 d's, diarrhea, dementia, dermatitis.<br /><strong>Vitamin C</strong> deficiency causes scurvy and your teeth will fall out which I just can't deal with!</p>","case 11, Pretend Exam"

This indicated the patient has a&nbsp;<strong>diastolic&nbsp;</strong>heart failure. If the patient had a systolic heart failure you may have heard S3 which indicates a dilated heart.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The CXR shows fluid in the lungs (white whispy stuff in lungs), more specifically the white arrows are pointing to Kerley B lines which are indicative of fluid in the lung interstitium. The bibasal crepitation are indicative of fluid in the lungs too. Orthopnea (breathlessness when lying flat) is as a result of fluid in the periphery moving back into the central venous system when you are lying down. In diastolic failure the ventricles are stiff so will not fill properly regardless of increased venous return which means there is a back up of blood into the atria, increasing the pressure in the atria. On the left side the increased pressure in the atria reflects into the pulmonary venous system and the pressure in the venous system increases to try and overcome the higher pressure in the atria. Increased pulmonary venous pressure leads to increased hydrostatic forces which push fluid from the blood into the tissue of the lung interstitium causing breathlessness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Considering the patient has pulmonary oedema and not peripheral oedema we can assume this is left sided heart failure (which may eventually cause right sided heart failure when the pressure in the lung venous pressure backs up into the right ventricle).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The patient gets breathless on <strong>mild exertion</strong> but not on minimal exertion (e.g. walking from room to room) or at rest so the NYHA class that best described him is class 2b.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reasons for breathlessness on exertion are:</p><p>1. The patient has reduced filling of his ventricles which means there is less blood at the end of diastole (decreased EDV) to push out resulting in a decreased stroke volume. SV X HR = CO therefore a reduced SV will cause a decreased cardiac output to the muscles. The muscles don't get the oxygenated blood they need to respire which means they have to respire anaerobically which produces lactic acid, resulting in metabolic acidodis. The patient will start to compensate for this by increasing the ventialtion rate to blow off CO2 and reduce the amount of acid in the blood. Hence the patient appears breathless.</p><p>2. The fluid in the lungs causes the alveoli to collapse which reduces the area for gaseous exchange.&nbsp;</p>","Cardiovascular Physiology, Cardiovascular system, Case 15"

This brings the wall stress back down, that is wall stress has been compensated for. This may be a reason why in diastolic failure NP results may be normal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After a while excessive burden on the contractile units in the ventricular muscle leads to excessive hypertrophy and this causes fibrosis of the heart muscle. Fibrosis means the walls of the ventricle become stiff and cant fill properly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In systolic failure the decreased pumping action means that the heart can't push out the blood leading to decreased SV. Filling is normal though so the residual blood from the previous beat and the blood coming in from the atria add up to result in an increased EDV. This results in a reduced ejection fraction. In systolic failure there is dilation of the heart chamber (increased r) and thinning of the ventricular wall (decreased h), that is the chamber has dilated out of proportion to the wall thickness.

This disrupts the competence of the valve which leads to the backflow of blood i.e. mitral regurgitation (responsible for the pansystolic murmur).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Ventouri effect also affects the aortic valve, the blood flows into the aorta at a greater velocity creating one upstoke in the carotid pulse, there is a downstroke due to the decreased pressure. Then later on in systole there is a second upstroke: bifid pulse.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Ventouri effect also causes anginal attacks. The blood flowing through the aorta is sucked backwards due to the decreased pressure which decreased flow to myocardial tissue. The hypertrophophic muscle also has an increased oxygen demand. Cumulatively, these mean the oxygen supply of the tissue does not meet the demand and causes angina.&nbsp;</p>","Cardiovascular Physiology, Cardiovascular system, Case 15, Heart"

He is recovering on the ward from heart surgery the previous day, and complains to the nurses of chest pain. His chest tube drainage volume has decreased, and an examination shows tachycardia, low arterial blood pressure, distended veins in the neck, pulsus paradoxus and, on ascultation, distant and muffled heart sounds. A chest X-ray shows a large, globular heart and was otherwise normal.

Further, he is recovering from recent heart surgery and a common cause of cardiac tamponade is clogged chest drains. All the other options are differential diagnoses of the condition, but the Major-General is unlikely to be suffering from constrictive pericarditis as he is not exhibiting Kussmaul's sign (a rise in jugular venous pressure during inspiration) and his X-ray shows an effusion (the globular heart) without any sign of calcification. It is also unlikely to be tension pneumothorax due to the otherwise-normal nature of the X-ray that was taken. Finally, myocardial infarction is also not the preferred diagnosis as the patient presents with Beck's triad and chest tube drainage volume drop-off - highly indicative of cardiac tamponade rather than MI.</p>","Heart, Clinical skills"

Whilst drinking a shake after a massive session of squats in the gym, he contemplates the process of digestion. He recalls that one of the enzymes involved in protein digestion (a proteolytic enzyme) in the stomach is pepsin and it's inactive precursor (zymogen) is pepsinogen. But he can't remember which cells in the stomach secrete pepsinogen.

Gastrin then stimulates the secretion of both intrinsic factor and hydrochloric acid from parietal cells. The hydrochloric acid catalyses the conversion of pesinogen to pepsin. The acidic environment created and pepsin are both important for the hydrolysis of proteins. Intrinsic factor is responsible for assisting absorption of vitamin B12 found in proteinaceous foods such as meat, fish and eggs. D cells (found in the antrum of the stomach) are stimulated by Gastrin and secrete somatostatin, a hormone which inhibits Gastrin excretion from G cells and hydrochloric acid from parietal cells (a negative feedback mechanism presenting the stomach becoming too acidic).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Leydig cells are testosterone producing cells found in the testicles.

Here's why:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The 1st hint&nbsp;was the inability to evert the foot. The&nbsp;muscles responsible for foot eversion are: Fibularis longus and&nbsp;Fibularis brevis. These two muscles are supplied by the superficial fibular nerve. At this point you might be thinking <em>""Hold on! What about Fibularis tertius?!""</em> Well fibularis tertius only <strong>aids</strong> in the everting of the foot. It's primary function is ankle dorsiflexion (it's supplied by deep fibular nerve).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The 2nd hint is the loss of sensation. So&nbsp;it says&nbsp;he&nbsp;lost sensation&nbsp;over the dorsum of&nbsp;his left&nbsp;foot with the exception of the lateral side of the fifth digit&nbsp;and the first interdigital cleft. The first interdigital cleft&nbsp;is supplied by the deep fibular nerve and the lateral side of the fifth digit is supplied by the sural nerve. The rest (i.e. majority of dosrum surface) is supplied by the superficial fibular nerve, so here again you should be thinking <em>""something's wrong with the superficial nerve.""</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;(this link shows you the foot dermatomes, in case you're a bit lost: <a class=""enteredLink"" href=""http://www.frca.co.uk/images/lowerlimb-fig8-small.jpg"" target=""_blank"">http://www.frca.co.uk/images/lowerlimb-fig8-small.jpg</a>)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now you can look back at the fact that his fracture is located at the midshaft of his fibula; what runs&nbsp;close along&nbsp;it there? The superficial fibular nerve!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here's another link that&nbsp;talks a bit about&nbsp;superficial fibular nerve and potential&nbsp;damage: <a class=""enteredLink"" href=""http://teachmeanatomy.info/lower-limb/nerves/superficial-fibular-nerve/"" target=""_blank"">http://teachmeanatomy.info/lower-limb/nerves/superficial-fibular-nerve/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another way of working this out is by ruling out answers:</p><p>1) The medial plantar, is a the larger branch of the&nbsp;tibial nerve, while the later plantar is the smaller branch.&nbsp;they both supply the skin of the plantar surface of the foot. Just look at their name: medial <strong>plantar</strong>, lateral <strong>plantar</strong>. The patient however suffers from loss of sensation on the dorsal surface!</p><p>2) As for the Saphenous nerve, it supplies the skin on the medial side of the foot as far as the head of the first metatarsal. It has no contribution to foot eversion. So it can't be this nerve.</p><p>3) Deep Fibular nerve doesn't contribute to foot eversion, but dorsiflexion and extension of the toes. It also supplies the skin at the first interdigital cleft,&nbsp;an area that&nbsp;the patient hasn't lost sensation in. So again it can't be this nerve.</p><p>&nbsp;This leaves us with superficial fibular nerve as the only answer :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>*Additional info:</p><p>Something you might find interesting is that the deep fibular nerve injury causes a foot drop!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Foot, Anatomy, Innervation, Innervations, Lower Limb"

Given that the patient is stable and the systolic blood pressure is above 90mmHg, this would be further classified as &lsquo;non-massive&rsquo; PE. According to the current British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines, all patients presenting with features suggestive of PE should be formally assessed for the clinical probability of PE. This is most commonly done using the &lsquo;Wells&rsquo; PE Score&rsquo;, which assigns certain features of the history/examination with a score such that the overall score can be used to determine the collective probability of a diagnosis of PE.<br />In this case, the probability of PE being the correct diagnosis is classified as high (score = 9). According to the BTS guidelines this negates the need for D-dimer testing, as this is only useful in those patients for whom the probability of PE is intermediate/low.<br />The correct management is to start treatment dose low molecular weight heparin, request a CT-pulmonary angiogram and then commence warfarin if this demonstrates the presence of a PE.<br />Note: isotope ventilation perfusion scanning is a plausible 1st line diagnostic investigation instead of CT-pulmonary angiogram in patients with no history of chest disease and a normal chest x-ray.

Stress --&gt; activation of the sympathetic nervous system --&gt; reduced secretions from the Brunner's glands (glands which are located in the duodenal submucosa and are responsible for the production of mucus- rich alkaline fluid). Less mucus- rich alkaline fluid means that the duodenal submucosa is more prone to attack from the acidic chyme entering the duodenum from the stomach.&nbsp;Therefore, STRESS WORSENS THE DUODENAL ULCER and the risk of a gastroduodenal artery erosion is higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If there is bleeding of an artery, I believe, adrenaline can be administered.

Folic acid deficiency leads to macrocytic anemia. The other deficiency that leads to macrocytic anemia is Vitamin B12 deficiency. Both folic acid and vitamin B12 are required for DNA synthesis. Thus, in the case of these deficiencies, DNA synthesis is impaired - the DNA which is required to instruct the RBCs to go further from the G2 phase into the M (mitosis) phase is unavailable. Therefore, the RBCs are&nbsp;'stuck' in the G2 phase - they keep growing and hence we call it macrocytic anemia.</li><li>One of the causes of microcytic anemia is iron- deficiency.</li><li>If iron- deficiency (microcytic anemia) and folate deficiency (macrocytic anemia) are occurring simultaneously, the result could be normocytic anemia.</li><li>Sickle cell anemia, thalassemia etc lead to haemolytic anemia.</li></ul><p>This question comes under Case 11 - maybe the Part II of this case.

For instance, we are not required to cover each type of haemolytic anemia in detail. All we are required to know is that certain vitamin deficiencies (.e.g folic acid or B12) or mineral deficiencies (iron) could lead to anemia; the anemia that folic acid deficiency produces is not the same as the anemia that iron deficiency produces - when you look underneath the microscope, the RBCs look different, of course, and the MCVs will be different.

In hypothyroidism, there is weight gain due to a decrease in the metabolic rate; on the other hand, in hyperthyroidism, there is weight loss de to an increase in the metabolic rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A few other symptoms of hyperthyroidism include: the 'stare' (eyes pushing out), palpitations, tremor etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cushing's syndrome, I hope everyone knows, is an increase in the cortisol levels. Cushing's syndrome can cause the patient to have an elevated blood pressure - cortisol enhances the vasoconstrictive effect of adrenaline and noradrenaline.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Addison's disease was covered as part of case 10. Addison's disease is an autoimmune disease and there is a destruction of the adrenal glands. In order to understand the symptoms caused by this disease, we must first appreciate the different regions of the adrenal glands and their respective functions:</p><p>a) Adrenal medulla - adrenaline and noradrenaline</p><p>b) Adrenal cortex which is composed of the zona glomerulosa (produces aldosterone), zona fasciculata (produces cortisol) and finally zona reticularis (produces sex steroids).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Addison's disease, since there are no adrenal glands, the hormones mentioned above cannot be produced - this leads to symptoms. Lack of aldosterone --&gt; decreased Na+ levels, increased K+ levels, increased H+ levels. A decrease in the Na+ levels leads to reduced blood pressure. Lack of cortisol --&gt; hypoglycaemia (Why? Because cortisol is responsible for elevating blood glucose levels. Remember that it works alongside glucagon and a few other hormones to elevate blood sugar levels).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pheochromocytoma = a tumour of the adrenal medulla. Massive amounts of adrenaline and NA are released into the bloodstream. Remember the five P's of Pheochromocytoma (someone covered this in an earlier question rather well) - Pressure, Palpitation, Pallor, Perspiration, Pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this is helpful.

When this occurs, there is a dramatic reduction in stroke volume because end-systolic volume is increased and end-diastolic volume are decreased. Both ejection fraction and stroke work are also decreased.<br />This combination of systolic and diastolic dysfunction, coupled with compensatory volume expansion, can lead to very high end-diastolic pressures that can cause pulmonary congestion and edema, as well as systemic edema and ascites (particularly when the right ventricle is in failure).

This can cause oedema. Not counteracted by falling ADH as osmoreceptors are set to lower threshold in pregnancy. Increased renin due to oestrogen from the placenta will increase ANGII which increases aldosterone secretion thus leading to conserving salt and water (so increased GFR). Progesterone also contributes to this by increasing potassium and sodium retention. Also pregnant women may experience increased thirst (due to ANGII) so increased fluid intake.</p><p><strong>GI changes</strong></p><p>Nausea and vomiting usually in first 12-14 weeks, can be severe and persisting (hyperemesis gravidarum) in 1 in 200 which can lead to dehydration and acid base imbalance. Constipation is common at any stage particularly later in pregnancy. This is due to enlarging uterus pressing on rectum and lower colon, relaxation of smooth muscle due to placental progesterone, decreased water content of stool due to increased water absorption (by increased ANGII and aldosterone), generally slowing of GI functions, slowed gastric emptying, decreased gut motility. Also relaxation of lower oesophageal sphincter leading to heartburn. Slowed bile flow increasing risk of gallstones.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Haematological changes</strong></p><p>RBC mass increases increases but not in proportion with Hb so mild dilution anaemia is normal. Small increase in WBC count and decrease in platelet count but within normal limits however pregnancy is a hypercoaguable state not because of platelet count but due to increased levels of fibrinogen and clotting factors increasing DVT risk</p><p><strong>Respiratory changes</strong></p><p>Vital capacity, respiratory rate, inspiratory reserve volume and partial pressure of oxygen mostly unchanged. Some minor reductions in lung volumes towards end of pregnancy due to uterus obstruction/ pushing against diaphragm (e.g. functional residual capacity, expiratory reserve volume, residual volume, total lung capacity).

The role NK cells play is analogous to that of cytotoxic T cells in the vertebrate adaptive immune response. NK cells provide rapid responses to viral-infected cells and respond to tumor formation, acting at around 3 days after infection. Typically, immune cells detect major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presented on infected cell surfaces, triggering cytokine release, causing lysis or apoptosis. NK cells are unique, however, as they have the ability to recognize stressed cells in the absence of antibodies and MHC, allowing for a much faster immune reaction.

Any DNA between these two gene segments is deleted. This D-J recombination is followed by the joining of one V gene segment, from a region upstream of the newly formed DJ complex, forming a rearranged VDJ gene segment. All other gene segments between V and D segments are now deleted from the cell&rsquo;s genome. Primary transcript (unspliced RNA) is generated containing the VDJ region of the heavy chain and both the constant mu and delta chains (C&mu; and C&delta;). (i.e. the primary transcript contains the segments: V-D-J-C&mu;-C&delta;). The primary RNA is processed to add a polyadenylated (poly-A) tail after the C&mu; chain and to remove sequence between the VDJ segment and this constant gene segment. Translation of this mRNA leads to the production of the Ig &mu; heavy chain protein.<br /><strong>Light chain of Igs</strong><br />The kappa (&kappa;) and lambda (&lambda;) chains of the immunoglobulin light chain loci rearrange in a very similar way, except the light chains lack a D segment. In other words, the first step of recombination for the light chains involves the joining of the V and J chains to give a VJ complex before the addition of the constant chain gene during primary transcription. Translation of the spliced mRNA for either the kappa or lambda chains results in formation of the Ig &kappa; or Ig &lambda; light chain protein.<br />Assembly of the Ig &mu; heavy chain and one of the light chains results in the formation of membrane bound form of the immunoglobulin IgM that is expressed on the surface of the immature B cell.</p><p><strong>In T cell receptors</strong><br />During thymocyte development, the T cell receptor (TCR) chains undergo essentially the same sequence of ordered recombination events as that described for immunoglobulins. D-to-J recombination occurs first in the &beta; chain of the TCR. This process can involve either the joining of the D&beta;1 gene segment to one of six J&beta;1 segments or the joining of the D&beta;2 gene segment to one of seven J&beta;2 segments. DJ recombination is followed (as above) with V&beta;-to-D&beta;J&beta; rearrangements. All gene segments between the V&beta;-D&beta;-J&beta; gene segments in the newly formed complex are deleted and the primary transcript is synthesized that incorporates the constant domain gene (V&beta;-D&beta;-J&beta;-C&beta;). mRNA transcription splices out any intervening sequence and allows translation of the full length protein for the TCR C&beta; chain.<br />The rearrangement of the alpha (&alpha;) chain of the TCR follows &beta; chain rearrangement, and resembles V-to-J rearrangement described for Ig light chains (see above). The assembly of the &beta;- and &alpha;- chains results in formation of the &alpha;&beta;-TCR that is expressed on a majority of T cells.</p>","Case 9, Immunology"

The first concerns the so called lag-phase, ie the time that separates the contact with the antigen and the appearance of specific antibodies. This is approximately 5-7 days for primary responses but is shortened to 2-3 days for secondary and later responses.</p><p>Primary vs secondary antibody responses<br />The second difference concerns the titre of the antibody response. Typically this is higher by several log factors in secondary or later responses. It should be stressed that common procedures for establishing the titre of the antibody response are confounded by the affinity issue (see below). Even allowing for this technical issue, however, the amount of specific antibody produced during secondary responses is higher than in primary.</p><p>The third difference concerns the isotype of the response: the primary response is dominated by IgM type antibody whereas the seondary and later response are typically dominated by IgG type antibodies. Thus between the primary and the secondary response a phenomenon of isotype switch takes place. The fourth and final difference concerns the affinity (ie the strength) of the binding of the antibody to its antigen. This is typically higher or much higher in the secondary response. Thus there is a complex set of differences between the response to the first antigenic challenge and the subsequent (so called anamnestic) ones.

However this can mostly be overcome with booster vaccinations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Further info on development of immune system</strong></p><p>Infants exhibit physiological immaturity of the immune system, more marked in the preterm or sick infant. Neutrophil bone marrow reserves are easily exhausted and neutrophil counts often fall in the face of sepsis. Chemotaxis is reduced, as are complement levels and function.</p><p>Circulating mature T and B lymphocytes are present in the fetus from the second trimester and lymphocyte numbers rise with gestation. However, lymphocyte responses to antigens, particularly immunoglobulin production, are limited until birth. Naive neonatal T lymphocytes are more difficult to stimulate than those of adults. Diminished T lymphocyte CD40 ligand expression reduces signalling to B lymphocytes through the CD40 receptor and depresses immunoglobulin isotype switching. Maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) is transferred to the fetus during the third trimester via the placenta, and so makes up for the deficit of intrinsic IgG production in the neonate. This is compromised with preterm birth and premature infants have significantly reduced IgG levels. The protective effect of maternal immunoglobulin depends on the mother having appropriate antigen-specific IgG antibody. Neonatal T lymphocyte responses are directed towards a T helper 2 (Th2) [interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10] rather than a Th1 (IL-2, interferon-&gamma;, tumour necrosis factor-&alpha;) response which may contribute to susceptibility to intracellular bacterial pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes or salmonella species. The immune response matures quite rapidly after birth. Initially IgM is produced, but as maternal IgG decays intrinsic IgG responses develop. By 2 months of age infants can produce IgG antibody responses to protein and conjugate vaccine antigens. As the maternal IgG level decays there is a physiological nadir in IgG level between 3 and 6 months, which may be prolonged while the infant's production is developing. Serum IgA levels rise more slowly than the other classes of immunoglobulin, not reaching adult levels until late adolescence. Production of IgG2 subclass antibody in which most anti-polysaccharide antibody responses are found is delayed in young children, partly explaining infant susceptibility to polysaccharide encapsulated organisms such as pneumococcus. These responses normally mature between about 2&ndash;5 years of age, but may be delayed beyond this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Pregnancy, Case 9, Immunology, Infectious Disease"

Lasting seven to 10 days, the rash progresses from red bumps to fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) that drain and scab over and drop off. Vesicles may also appear in the mouth, on the scalp, around the eyes or on the genitals and can be very painful. The initial infection generally starts as a fever, followed by cold symptoms and the rash.</p><p>This cycle repeats itself in new areas of the body until finally, after about two weeks, all of the sores have healed. The disease is contagious until all the spots have dried up. Unfortunately, the virus is also contagious for at least one day before the rash breaks out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>http://www.medicinenet.com/skin_pictures_child_pictures_slideshow/article.htm</p><p>This link is has a really good summary and some pictures of common rashes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Heat Rash ('Prickly Heat'):<br />Young babies often get heat rash. Blocked sweat glands cause heat rash, which results in a red pimply eruption on the head and neck. It's important to dress your infant appropriately (not too hot and not too cold) to prevent the eruption. Generally, heat rash resolves on its own.</p><p>Impetigo:</p><p>Impetigo can be confused with other skin infections, including cellulitis (a deeper infection) and even ringworm. Common bacteria found on the skin cause impetigo, and antibiotics easily treat impetigo. The rash itself looks oozy, blistery, and red initially and then may develop a yellowish crust. It spreads by contact, and scratching makes it worse. Impetigo can occur anywhere on the body, but it's commonly found around the mouth and nose.</p><p>Molluscum contagiosum (MC):</p><p>MC is a viral infection that affects the skin. It most commonly affects children, although it can occur at any age.<br />Usually, the only symptom of MC is a number of small, firm, raised papules (spots) that develop on the skin. They are not painful, but can be itchy.<br />Although the spots can look unpleasant, MC is generally a harmless condition that will normally resolve in a few months without any specific treatment.</p><p>Utricaria (hives):</p><p>Hives are the result of an allergic reaction. They appear as small red itchy bumps or welts, which may be painful as well. Exposure to an allergen, such as a food or medicine, may cause hives. Some common allergies include nuts, eggs, and shellfish, but certain viruses can also cause hives. Although hives alone are not dangerous, if your child develops breathing troubles, including cough and wheezing along with the hives, it might signal a more serious allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention. Antihistamines are the standard treatment for hives.</p><p>Here is a really great algorithm for diagnosing rashes from Patient.co.uk, below I have defined some of the terms used in the algorithm:</p><p><img src=""http://medical.cdn.patient.co.uk/images/rash2.png"" alt="""" width=""825"" height=""614"" />&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Papular</strong> =&nbsp;A papule is a circumscribed, solid elevation of skin with no visible fluid, varying in size from a pinhead to 1 cm.

The oxytocin then causes an increase in intracellualr volume of calcium which causes contraction of myoepithelial cells which alveoli cells underneath to eject milk into the duct. 2nd pathway from hypothalamus causes a decrease in prolactin inhibiting hormone (dopamine).

Their main role is producing <strong>type 1 interferons (IFN-&alpha;/&beta;)</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>All other proteins in the answers are involved in viral infection in some way.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Inflammatory chemokines</strong>&nbsp;are formed under pathological conditions (on pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, LPS, or viruses) and actively participate in the inflammatory response attracting immune cells to the site of inflammation.&nbsp;Chemokines are essential mediators of inflammation and important for control of viral infections.&nbsp;Their release is often stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1. Inflammatory chemokines function mainly as chemoattractants for leukocytes, recruiting monocytes, neutrophils and other effector cells from the blood to sites of infection or tissue damage. There are two sub-group (CC and CXC) specific numbers are those thought to be most involved in viral infection</p><p><strong>Interferon Gamma (IFN-&gamma;)</strong>:&nbsp;only member of the type II class of interferons,&nbsp;is a cytokine that is critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral, some bacterial and protozoal infections. IFN&gamma; is an important activator of macrophages and inducer of Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule expression. The importance of IFN&gamma; in the immune system stems in part from its ability to inhibit viral replication directly, and most importantly from its immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory effects. IFN&gamma; is produced predominantly by natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells as part of the innate immune response, and by CD4 Th1 and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) effector T cells once antigen-specific immunity develops.&nbsp;There is accumulating evidence that IFN-&alpha;/&beta; contributes to driving the adaptive-immune response in the T helper cell type 1 (Th1) direction via stimulation of IFN-&gamma; expression.&nbsp;The cellular antiviral response is initiated by activation of NK cells, which kill virus-infected cells directly and also activate other cells of the innate- and adaptive-immune system through production of cytokines, notably IFN-&gamma;. One of the IFN-&gamma;-activated leukocytes is the macrophage, which is sensitive to IFN-&gamma; and other proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor &alpha; (TNF-&alpha;)</p><p><strong>Interleukins 6 and 1-Beta (IL6 and IL-1B):&nbsp;</strong>After the virus is detected by TLRs, major inflammatory mediators including cytokines and eicosanoids are released from sentinel cells. Macrophages produce a range of these cytokines, IL6 and IL1B are pyrogenic, acting on the hypothalamus to increase body temperature and on muscle to increase fat and protein utilisation causing fever to try and prevent viral replication which is sensitive to high temperatures. Another key cytokine is IL12 which plays key role in activation of natural killer cells.</p><p><strong>TNF-alpha:&nbsp;</strong>TNF was thought to be produced primarily by macrophages,[30] but it is produced also by a broad variety of cell types including lymphoid cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, cardiac myocytes, adipose tissue, fibroblasts, and neurons. Large amounts of TNF are released in response to lipopolysaccharide, other bacterial products, and Interleukin-1 (IL-1). TNF-alpha&nbsp;has a number of actions on various organ systems, generally together with IL-1 and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) it acts as a pyrogen in the same way as described above</p><p><strong>Type 1 interferons (IFN-&alpha;/&beta;):</strong>&nbsp;In general, type I interferons are produced when the body recognizes a virus has invaded it and are mainly involved in innate immune response against viral infection. When facing a viral infection, most cell types in the body respond by secreting high levels of type 1 interferons (IFN-&alpha;/&beta;). This induction occurs within a few hours of the infection, and IFN-&alpha;/&beta; has a number of antiviral functions. However, the production of type I IFN-&alpha; is prohibited by another cytokine known as Interleukin-10. Once activated, type I interferons will create molecules which prevent the virus from producing and replicating it's RNA and DNA.&nbsp;</p><p>First, IFN-&alpha;/&beta; directly induces antiviral activities in the uninfected, neighboring cells. This prevents viral spread by increasing the resistance of uninfected cells toward the virus. Second, IFNs can activate natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxity toward virus-infected cells. Third, there is accumulating evidence that IFN-&alpha;/&beta; contributes to driving the adaptive-immune response in the T helper cell type 1 (Th1) direction via stimulation of IFN-&gamma; expression.</p>","Virology, Case 9, Cell Signalling, Immunology"

Definitely worth checking out to get your head around this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Information</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phosphorylases</strong> are enzymes that catalyze the addition of a phosphate group from an inorganic phosphate (phosphate+hydrogen) to an acceptor</p><p>A <strong>protein kinase</strong> is a kinase enzyme that modifies other proteins by chemically adding phosphate groups to them</p><p><strong>Phosphatases</strong> are enzymes that remove phosphate groups from substrates by hydrolysing phosphoric acid monoesters into a phosphate ion and a molecule with a free hydroxyl group (<em>remember phospha<strong>tases&nbsp;take</strong> phosphate)</em></p><p><strong>Glycogen phosphorylase</strong> is one of the phosphorylase enzymes. Glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glycogenolysis by releasing glucose-1-phosphate from the terminal alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond.Glycogen phosphorylase breaks up glycogen into glucose subunits.</p><p>Functional glycogen phosphorylase a or b are homodimeric enzymes that&nbsp;each exist in two forms a T (tense, less active) inactive state and R (relaxed, more active) state. Phosphorylase b is normally in the T state, inactive due to the physiological presence of ATP and Glucose 6 phosphate, and Phosphorylase a is normally in the R state (active).</p><p><strong>Glycogen synthase</strong> (UDP-glucose-glycogen glucosyltransferase) is an enzyme involved in converting glucose to glycogen. It takes short polymers of glucose and converts them into long polymers of glycogen.&nbsp;The reaction is highly regulated by allosteric effectors such as glucose-6-phosphate, by phosphorylation reactions, and indirectly triggered by the hormone insulin, which is secreted by the pancreas. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase decreases its activity.&nbsp;Glycogen synthase is also regulated by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which activates glycogen synthase via dephosphorylation</p><p><strong>Phosphorylase kinase</strong> is capable of binding to glycogen when the enzyme is in the R state. This conformation is enhanced by binding of AMP (allosteric activator) and inhibited by binding of ATP or glucose-6-phosphate (allosteric inhibitors).&nbsp;There are two isoforms of phosphorylase kinase, one expressed in skeletal muscle and the other expressed in the liver.</p><p><strong>PP1</strong> is important to the reciprocal regulation of glycogen metabolism by ensuring the opposite regulation of glycogen breakdown and glycogen synthesis. Responsible for removal of phosphate from glycogen phosphatase (deactivating it) and activating&nbsp;glycogen synthase therefore increasing glycogenesis and decreasing glycogenolysis. Also converts phosphorylase kinase a to phosphorylase kinase b (less active) which is then responsible for less glycogenolysis. Is inhibited by PPI (also activated by cAMP, PKA etc due to effect of glucagon)&nbsp;Glycogen synthase is also regulated by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which activates glycogen synthase via dephosphorylation</p><p><strong>Mechanism of action of these hormones:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Glycogen phosphorylase is regulated by both allosteric control and by phosphorylation.</li><li>Hormones such as epinephrine, insulin and glucagon regulate glycogen phosphorylase using second messenger amplification systems that are linked to G proteins.</li><li><strong>Epinephrine</strong> activates adenylate cyclase through a seven transmembrane receptor coupled to Gs which, in turn, activates adenylate cyclase to increase intracellular concentrations of cAMP. cAMP binds to and releases an active form of protein kinase A (PKA). Next, PKA phosphorylates phosphorylase kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase b, transforming it into the active glycogen phosphorylase a.</li><li>In the liver, <strong>glucagon</strong> activates another G-protein-linked receptor that triggers a different cascade, resulting in the activation of Phospholipase C (PLC). PLC indirectly causes the release of calcium from the hepatocytes' endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. The increased calcium availability binds to the calmodulin subunit and activates glycogen phosphorylase kinase. Glycogen phosphorylase kinase activates glycogen phosphorylase in the same manner mentioned previously</li><li><strong>AMP:&nbsp;</strong>Glycogen phosphorylase b is not always inactive in muscle, as it can be activated allosterically by AMP. An increase in AMP concentration, which occurs during strenuous exercise, signals energy demand. AMP activates glycogen phosphorylase b by changing its conformation from a tense to a relaxed form. This relaxed form has similar enzymatic properties as the phosphorylated enzyme. An increase in ATP concentration opposes this activation by displacing AMP from the nucleotide binding site, indicating sufficient energy stores</li><li><strong>Insulin</strong> indirectly activates PP-1 and phosphodiesterase.&nbsp;The activity of PP1 is affected by insulin, PP-1 directly dephosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase a, reforming the inactive glycogen phosphorylase b.&nbsp;The action of insulin increases the activity of phosphodiesterase which hydrolyzes cAMP to AMP thereby reducing the level of/inhibiting PKA. In this manner, PKA can no longer cause the phosphorylation cascade that ends with formation of (active) glycogen phosphorylase a. These modifications initiated by insulin end glycogenolysis in order to preserve what glycogen stores are left in the cell and trigger glycogenesis (rebuilding of glycogen).&nbsp;Insulin also exerts a negative effect on the activity of GSK-3 (one of the number of kinases that&nbsp;phosphorylate and deactivate glycogen synthase due to glucagon)&nbsp;such that there is a reduced level of phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by this kinase.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pancreatic hormone exerts an opposing effect to that of glucagon and epinephrine.</li></ul>","Biochemistry, Endocrine, Case 10, Hormones"

The first key is to work out what diagnosis his signs and symptoms are pointing to. Fatigue, weight loss, shortness of breath and clubbing all point to <strong>pulmonary fibrosis</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The next stage is to ask yourself which of the following drugs can be associated with causing pulmonary fibrosis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer is D, amiodarone is linked to both thyroid dysfunction and pulmonary fibrosis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A - Simvastatin. This drug does have numerous side-effects, including abdominal pain, diarrhoea and indigestion.</p><p>B - Bisoprolol - ADRs include fatigue, hypotension and bradycardia. Although it would explain the fatigue, it is not the single best explanation of this presentation.</p><p>C - Ramipril. Although ramipril can cause cough, but again, it is not the single best answer.</p><p>E - Aspirin.

It includes the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and several other nearby areas.

In this drawing, you are looking at the brain cut in half, but with the brain stem intact.

It produces melatonin, a serotonin derived hormone, which affects the modulation of sleep patterns in both seasonal and circadian rhythms. Its shape resembles a tiny pine cone (hence its name), and it is located in the epithalamus, near the center of the brain, between the two hemispheres, tucked in a groove where the two halves of the thalamus join. (<em>See first diagram for location)</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>More info on the hypothalamus:</em></p><p>The hypothalamus is a small part of the brain located just below the thalamus on both sides of the third ventricle. (The ventricles are areas within the cerebrum that are filled with cerebrospinal fluid, and connect to the fluid in the spine.) It sits just inside the two tracts of the optic nerve, and just above (and intimately connected with) the pituitary gland.</p><p>The hypothalamus is one of the busiest parts of the brain, and is mainly concerned with homeostasis. Homeostasis is the process of returning something to some &ldquo;set point.&rdquo; It works like a thermostat: When your room gets too cold, the thermostat conveys that information to the furnace and turns it on. As your room warms up and the temperature gets beyond a certain point, it sends a signal that tells the furnace to turn off.</p><p>The hypothalamus is responsible for regulating your hunger, thirst, response to pain, levels of pleasure, sexual satisfaction, anger and aggressive behavior, and more. It also regulates the functioning of the autonomic nervous system (see below), which in turn means it regulates things like pulse, blood pressure, breathing, and arousal in response to emotional circumstances.</p><p>The hypothalamus receives inputs from a number of sources. From the vagus nerve, it gets information about blood pressure and the distension of the gut (that is, how full your stomach is). From the reticular formation in the brainstem, it gets information about skin temperature. From the optic nerve, it gets information about light and darkness. From unusual neurons lining the ventricles, it gets information about the contents of the cerebrospinal fluid, including toxins that lead to vomiting. And from the other parts of the limbic system and the olfactory (smell) nerves, it gets information that helps regulate eating and sexuality. The hypothalamus also has some receptors of its own, that provide information about ion balance and temperature of the blood.</p><p>In one of the more recent discoveries, it seems that there is a protein called leptin which is released by fat cells when we overeat. The hypothalamus apparently senses the levels of leptin in the bloodstream and responds by decreasing appetite. It would seem that some people have a mutation in a gene which produces leptin, and their bodies can&rsquo;t tell the hypothalamus that they have had enough to eat. However, many overweight people do not have this mutation, so there is still a lot of research to do!</p><p>The hypothalamus sends instructions to the rest of the body in two ways. The first is to the autonomic nervous system. This allows the hypothalamus to have ultimate control of things like blood pressure, heartrate, breathing, digestion, sweating, and all the sympathetic and parasympathetic functions.</p><p>The other way the hypothalamus controls things is via the pituitary gland. It is neurally and chemically connected to the pituitary, which in turn pumps hormones called releasing factors into the bloodstream. As you know, the pituitary is the so-called &ldquo;master gland,&rdquo; and these hormones are vitally important in regulating growth and metabolism.</p><p>http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/limbicsystem.html</p>","Sleep, Endocrine, Case 12, Physiology, Head and Neck"

For example, it can develop in someone who has a problem with the brainstem, which controls breathing.</p><p>Conditions that can cause or lead to central sleep apnea include:</p><p>Problems that affect the brainstem (the brainstem controls breathing) including brain infection, stroke, or conditions of the cervical spine (neck)<br />Parkinson disease<br />Obesity<br />Certain medicines, such as narcotic painkillers<br />Heart failure<br />If the apnea is not associated with another disease, it is called idiopathic central sleep apnea.</p><p>A condition called Cheyne-Stokes respiration can mimic central sleep apnea. This involves breathing to a variable depth, usually while sleeping.</p><p>Central sleep apnea is not the same as obstructive sleep apnea. With obstructive sleep apnea, breathing stops and starts because the airway is narrowed or blocked. But a person can have both conditions, such as with a medical problem called obesity hypoventilation syndrome.</p><p>obstructive sleep apnoea :&nbsp;a clinical condition in which there is intermittent and repeated upper airway collapse during sleep. This results in irregular breathing at night and excessive sleepiness during the day.</p><p>Complete apnoea is defined as a ten-second pause in breathing activity.<br />Partial apnoea, also known as hypopnoea, is characterised by a ten-second period in which ventilation is reduced by at least 50%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B) FALSE: you can have tiredness from both</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>C) FALSE: I made this up :)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>D) FALSE: OSA is more common in larger individuals - obesity is a strong risk factor for OSA.

People with cardiovascular problems such as high blood pressure, heart failure, and stroke have a high prevalence of sleep apnea. Whether sleep apnea actually causes heart disease is still unclear, but we do know that if you have sleep apnea today, the chance that you will develop hypertension in the future increases significantly.</p><p>One of the problems in defining the relationship between sleep apnea and heart disease is that people with sleep apnea often have other co-existing diseases as well.</p><p>If you treat people with high blood pressure and sleep apnea, or heart failure and sleep apnea, the measures of blood pressure or heart failure are significantly improved.

In response to elevated sodium, the macula densa cells trigger contraction of the afferent arteriole, reducing flow of blood to the glomerulus and the glomerular filtration rate. The juxtaglomerular cells, derived from smooth muscle cells, of the afferent arteriole secrete renin when blood pressure in the arteriole falls.

The activated receptor in turn couples to Gq/11 and Gi/o and thus activates phospholipase C and increases the cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, which in turn triggers cellular responses such as stimulation of protein kinase C. Activated receptor also inhibits adenylate cyclase and activates various tyrosine kinases.<br />Effects mediated by the AT1 receptor include vasoconstriction, aldosterone synthesis and secretion, increased vasopressin secretion, cardiac hypertrophy, augmentation of peripheral noradrenergic activity, vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation, decreased renal blood flow, renal renin inhibition, renal tubular sodium reuptake, modulation of central sympathetic nervous system activity, cardiac contractility, central osmocontrol and extracellular matrix formation</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AT2</strong>: angiotensin II type 2 receptor.&nbsp;AT2 receptors are more plentiful in the fetus and neonate. The AT2 receptor remains enigmatic and controversial &ndash; is probably involved in vascular growth.

Which of these statements about LVADs is&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>?</p>","<p>Implanting an LVAD is a good alternative to a heart transplant</p>","<p>LVADs are good but if the main battery power fails the patient can die within minutes</p>","<p>One end of the LVAD pump is connected to the left ventricle and the other end to the right ventricle</p>","<p>Symptoms and quality of life are significantly improved by LVADs&nbsp;</p>","<p>There is no way of telling whether a patient has had an LVAD just by looking at them</p>","<p><strong>D is correct. What difference do LVADs make to your patients&rsquo; lives?</strong><br />Most patients who are considered for an LVAD have a very limited quality of life before the operation. They feel tired, weak and are very breathless. Some have difficulty getting washed and dressed and they might not be able to leave the house.</p><p>As soon as the LVAD is implanted, the blood supply to the body returns to normal, so heart failure symptoms improve. Patients who have been too unwell to walk around are quickly able to get up and about. Many patients can soon return to other normal activities like driving and going on holiday; some of them even return to work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A is incorrect</strong> as whilst LVADs are good at bridging the gap and prolonging life while waiting for a heart transplant a suitable heart transplant would still be preferrable. In some cases they are now being looked into as destination therapies but mainly are just a bridge to recovery or transplant.&nbsp;Ironically, because many patients get so much better after receiving an LVAD, some become a lower priority on the heart transplant list as a result. This is because there&rsquo;s often someone sicker (who doesn&rsquo;t have the device) who is more in need of a transplant.</p><p>The longest that we&rsquo;ve supported a patient for with an LVAD has been five and a half years. Nowadays, 80&ndash;85 per cent of patients are alive a year after having an LVAD fitted and 70&ndash;75 per cent after two years. This is fantastic considering that many of them would only have had a life expectancy of 12 months or less before their LVAD treatment</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>B is incorrect</strong> as if&nbsp;the main battery starts to run low, an alarm sounds to let the person know that it needs changing. An additional battery is always connected to the controller, so if one battery runs down, there is another to power the LVAD for several more hours. Additionally, there is back-up circuitry in the controller, so if the primary circuitry happens to fail, the back-up system kicks in. Modern LVADs are, therefore, very reliable and can support patients for years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>C is incorrect</strong> as&nbsp;implantation LVAD involves a big operation/open heart surgery as surgeon attaches one end of the LVAD pump to the left ventricle and the other end to the aorta. Blood flows from the ventricle into the LVAD. The device pumps the blood out into the aorta, where it then flows to the rest of the body.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>E is incorrect</strong> as&nbsp;fine cable called the driveline connects the LVAD, which is inside the body, through the skin and to a controller, which is outside the body. The controller senses the function of the LVAD and controls the power to make it work. The controller connects to an external battery pack which would be visible to a doctor who knew what they were looking for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-matters-magazine/medical/lvads - Really good info on LVADs</p>","Cardiology, Case 15, Heart, Heart failure, surgery"

This is thought to be due to their more selective arteriolar vasodilation (as opposed to venous).&nbsp;</p><p>Amlodipine inhibits calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells.&nbsp;Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.</p><p><strong>Side effects</strong> include:<br />Common: peripheral edema and fatigue<br />Uncommon: blood disorders, development of breasts in men (gynecomastia), impotence, depression, insomnia, tachycardia, or gingival enlargement<br />Rarely: erratic behavior, hepatitis, jaundice</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Direct (arteriolar) vasodilator drugs also cause oedema by enhancing renal sodium reabsorption through their blood pressure effect and activation of RAAS. Class 1c Na channel blockers can cause heart failure and thus lead to or worsen peripheral oedema.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Amiodarone:</strong>&nbsp;is a member of a class of antiarrhythmic drugs with predominantly Class III (K channel blocker),&nbsp;prolongs phase 3 of the cardiac action potential, the repolarization phase where there is normally decreased calcium permeability and increased potassium permeability.&nbsp;Very common side effects (More than 1 in 10 people):&nbsp;abnormal laboratory test results,&nbsp;corneal deposits,&nbsp;eye or eyesight problems,&nbsp;nausea,&nbsp;photosensitivity skin reactions with redness, tingling, burning or blistering of the skin,&nbsp;taste changes,&nbsp;vomiting</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bisoprolol</strong>:</p><p>A beta-blocker which is used to&nbsp;decrease myocardial infarction mortality and&nbsp;prevent recurrence of tachyarrhythmias. It selectively and competitively blocks catecholamine (adrenalin) stimulation of &beta;1 adrenergic receptors (adrenoreceptors), which are mainly found in the heart muscle cells and heart conduction tissue (cardiospecific), but also found in juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney. It&nbsp;decreases the adrenergic tone/stimulation of the heart muscle and pacemaker cells. Decreased adrenergic tone shows less contractility of heart muscle and lowered heart rate of pacemakers.&nbsp;<br />Side effects include:&nbsp;Overdose of bisoprolol leading to fatigue, hypotension, low blood sugar, bronchospasms, and bradycardia.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Digoxin</strong></p><p>Digoxin is occasionally used in the treatment of various heart conditions, namely atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and sometimes heart failure that cannot be controlled by other medication.&nbsp;Digoxin&rsquo;s primary mechanism of action involves inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase, mainly in the myocardium. This inhibition causes an increase in intracellular sodium levels, resulting in a reversal of the action of the sodium-calcium exchanger, which normally imports three extracellular sodium ions into the cell and transports one intracellular calcium ion out of the cell. The reversal of this exchange causes an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration that is available to the contractile proteins. Increased intracellular calcium lengthens phase 4 and phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, which leads to a decrease in heart rate. Increased amounts of Ca2+ also leads to increased storage of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing a corresponding increase in the release of calcium during each action potential. This leads to increased contractility (the force of contraction) of the heart without increasing heart energy expenditure.</p><p>Common adverse effects (&ge;1% of patients) include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea as gastrointestinal motility increases. Other common effects are blurred vision, visual disturbances (yellow-green halos and problems with color perception), confusion, drowsiness, dizziness, insomnia, nightmares, agitation, and depression, as well as a higher acute sense of sensual activities</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spironolactone:</strong></p><p>Belongs to a class of pharmaceutical drugs known as potassium-sparing diuretics, and is used primarily as a diuretic and antihypertensive in the treatment of heart failure and hypertension.&nbsp;Spironolactone is used primarily to treat heart failure, edematous conditions such as nephrotic syndrome or ascites in patients with liver disease, essential hypertension, hypokalemia, secondary hyperaldosteronism (such as occurs with hepatic cirrhosis), and Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). Along with many other MOAs, the relevant one here is&nbsp;Spironolactone inhibiting the effects of mineralocorticoids, namely, aldosterone, by displacing them from mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in the cortical collecting duct of renal nephrons. This decreases the reabsorption of sodium and water, while limiting the excretion of potassium (A K+ sparing diuretic). The drug has a slightly delayed onset of action, and so it takes several days for diuresis to occur.</p><p>The most common side effect of spironolactone is urinary frequency. Other general side effects include ataxia, drowsiness, dry skin, and rashes. Because it reduces androgen levels and blocks androgen receptors, spironolactone can, in males, cause breast tenderness, gynecomastia, and physical feminization in general, as well as testicular atrophy, reversible infertility, and sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. In females, spironolactone can cause menstrual irregularities and breast tenderness and enlargement, likely due to a combination of its progestogenic and indirect estrogenic actions.&nbsp;The most important potential side effect of spironolactone is hyperkalemia, which can be life-threatening</p>","Cardiology, Case 13, Case 15, Pharmacology, Heart failure"

It can cause severe physical and mental disability that begins in early childhood.&nbsp;Most cases of Rett syndrome are caused by a mutation (change in the DNA) in the MECP2 gene, which is found on the X chromosome (so almost always seen in girls), although mutations in other genes have been found in some cases where the symptoms don't quite follow the classic pattern described above.<br />The MECP2 gene contains instructions to make a particular protein (MeCP2) that is vital for brain development. The gene abnormality prevents nerve cells in the brain from developing properly.<br />Although Rett syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation, almost all cases are sporadic and occur without any family history of the condition. This is known as a 'de novo' mutation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conn's syndrome:&nbsp;</strong>a disease of the adrenal glands involving excess production of a hormone, called aldosterone. Another name for the condition is primary hyperaldosteronism. Can cause potentially curable high blood pressure (hypertension).&nbsp;Often it produces few symptoms but most people have high blood pressure which may cause poor vision or headaches.&nbsp;Primary hyperaldosteronism has a number of causes. About 66% of cases are due to enlargement of both adrenal glands and 33% of cases are due to an adrenal adenoma that produces aldosterone. Other uncommon causes include adrenal cancer and an inherited disorder called familial hyperaldosteronism</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>D:&nbsp;</strong>No idea whether it increases sex drive in under 16s but I highly doubt it, just couldn't think of another potential option and thought this might amuse people. If it did increase sex drive in under 16s would unlikely be a reason not to prescribe it as likely the benefit would outweigh this risk.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>E:</strong> NSAIDs in general can compromise renal function in all patients by altering renal haemodynamics. Inhibits production of prostaglandins that would usually dilate afferent arteriole of glomeruli so leads to unopposed constriction of afferent arteriole and reduced renal perfusion pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>NSAIDs are also contra-indicated in pregnancy</p>","Case 1, Pain, Case 14, Pharmacology"

In humans, this condition is caused by over-production of growth hormone in childhood resulting in persons between 2.13 m (7 feet or 84 inches) and 2.74 m (9 feet or 108 inches) in height.</li><li>If there is hypersecretion of GH &nbsp;causing increased growth of soft tissues and bone&nbsp;<strong>before the fusion of the epiphyses</strong> this is called gigantism (often in children)</li><li>If there is hypersecretion of GH causing increased growth <strong>after the fusion of the epiphyses</strong> in adults, this is acromegaly and has more associated symptoms</li><li>Complete fusion in females occurs as early as 12 years and is usually complete by 16 years in girls. Complete fusion in males can occur as early as 14 years and is usually complete by age 19.&nbsp;<em>Therefore, Hagrid was already excessively tall before this fusion took place so he has gigantism not acromegaly</em></li><li>It causes growth of the hands, face, and feet.</li></ul><p><strong>What Causes Gigantism?</strong><br />A pituitary gland tumor is almost always the cause of gigantism. The pea-sized pituitary gland&mdash;located at the base of your brain&mdash;makes hormones that control many functions in your body. Some tasks managed by the gland include temperature control, sexual development, growth metabolism, and urine production. When a tumor grows on the pituitary gland, the gland makes more growth hormone than the body needs. Other less common causes of gigantism may include:</p><ul><li>McCune-Albright syndrome: a disease that causes abnormal growth in bone tissue, patches of light-brown skin, and gland abnormalities</li><li>Carney complex: an inherited condition that causes non-cancerous tumors on the connective tissue, cancerous or non-cancerous endocrine tumors, and spots of darker skin</li><li>multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: an inherited disorder that causes tumors in the pituitary gland, pancreas, or parathyroid glands</li><li>neurofibromatosis: an inherited disorder that causes tumors in the nervous system</li></ul><p><strong>Acromegaly:&nbsp;</strong>is a syndrome that results when the anterior pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone (GH) after epiphyseal plate closure at puberty.&nbsp;A number of disorders may increase the pituitary's GH output, although most commonly it involves a tumor called pituitary adenoma, derived from a distinct type of cell (somatotrophs).&nbsp;Acromegaly most commonly affects adults in middle age, and can result in severe disfigurement, complicating conditions, and premature death if unchecked. Because of its pathogenesis and slow progression, the disease is hard to diagnose in the early stages and is frequently missed for years until changes in external features, especially of the face, become noticeable. Some of the feature include:</p><ul><li>Soft tissue swelling visibly resulting in enlargement of the hands, feet, nose, lips and ears, and a general thickening of the skin.</li><li>Soft tissue swelling of internal organs, notably the heart with attendant weakening of its muscularity, and the kidneys, also the vocal cords resulting in a characteristic thick, deep voice and slowing of speech</li><li>Generalized expansion of the skull at the fontanelle</li><li>Pronounced brow protrusion, often with ocular distension (frontal bossing)</li><li>Pronounced lower jaw protrusion (prognathism) with attendant macroglossia (enlargement of the tongue) and teeth spacing</li><li>Hypertrichosis, hyperpigmentation, and hyperhidrosis may occur in these patients</li><li>Acrochordon (skin tags)</li><li>Carpal tunnel syndrome</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Klinefelter syndrome</strong>&nbsp;also known as 47,XXY or XXY, is the set of symptoms that result from two or more X chromosome in males. The primary feature is sterility. Often symptoms may be subtle and many people do not realize they are affected. Sometimes symptoms are more prominent and may include weaker muscles, greater height, poor coordination, less body hair, smaller genitals, breast growth, and less interest in sex. -<em> although Hagrid is tall he also has a large beard and big hands/face/feet which wouldn't be expected in Klinefleter's</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Precocious puberty:&nbsp;</strong>is puberty occurring at an unusually early age. In most cases, the process is normal in every respect except the unusually early age, and simply represents a variation of normal development. In a minority of children, the early development is triggered by a disease such as a tumor or injury of the brain.&nbsp;Even when there is no disease, unusually early puberty can have adverse effects on social behavior and psychological development, can reduce adult height potential, and may shift some lifelong health risks. -&nbsp;<em>this is unlikely as although he did grow very large very early this would likely reduce his maximum height reached rather than increase it</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WAIT! Why isn't he just a giant?!</strong></p><ul><li>A giant is a very large humanoid which can potentially grow to approximately twenty five feet tall and appear to be a large human. (<em>this Hagrid wouldn't be tall enough to qualify!)</em></li><li>Some may appear as large and hairy humanoids, while others resemble humongous-sized people, and some may even have bestial features (i.e. protuding sharp molars).&nbsp;<em>None of the others features were reported<br /></em></li><li>A powerful and nearly unstoppable race, giants generally aggregate themselves in tribes since their numbers have greatly dwindled in recent centuries.&nbsp;<em>You wouldn't be able to have a sensible conversation with a giant and they wouldn't be able to hold down a teaching job</em></li><li>Half-giants are beings with some, but not a total, amount of giant heritage or blood, as well as part human blood. For instance, a human might have a Giant mother and a wizard father or vice versa. However, the logistics of a normal-sized witch bearing a half-giant baby are difficult if not impossible to imagine, let alone the logistics of this sort of conception.</li><li>The real Hagrid was at least 11ft and 6inches, vastly taller than the tallest ever human even as a half giant so this can likely be ruled out too!</li></ul>","Superheroes with issues, Endocrine, Year 1 Revision, Hormones, year 1"

It does this by inhibiting PEPCK.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B) Correct! Normally, at a high glucose concentration, glucose diffuses into Beta islet cells through GLUT 2 transporters. It is then converted to Glucose 6 phosophate by glucose kinase and enters the kreb's cycle within the mitochondria. The ATP produced goes to CLOSE potassium channels. The increased concentration of potassium in the cells causes depolarisation and calcium entry which causes insulin secretion by exocytosis of vesicles.</p><p>Glicazide binds to these potassium channels and closes them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>C) Gliptins work by inhibiting the DDP4 enzyme which breaks down incretins. Incretins such as GLP1 and GIP block the potassium channels mentioned above which causes insulin secretion by the same mechanism.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>D) Glitazones bind to PPAR gamma. They form a complex which acts as a transcription factor for GLUT4 which is upregulated. This allows for faster uptake of glucose, particularly in adipocytes where lipogenesis and fatty acid uptake also occurs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>E) Acarbose is a man-made oligosaccharide which competitively inhibits alpha-glycosidase enzymes.

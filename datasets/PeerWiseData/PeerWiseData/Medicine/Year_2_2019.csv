Their job is to recognise foreign antigens, become activated and present fragments of the antigen on their MHC. In the context of viral infections, viruses invade cDCs and find themselves in the cytosol, whereby proteosomes traffic them to the ER where they come into contact with MHC-I. MHC-I and the antigen fragment are packaged in the golgi into a vescile and sent to the plasma membrane. cDCs upregulate CCR7 receptors which then allow them to follow a signal to the nearest lymph node to present the antigen fragment to naive CD8+ cells.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>pDCs are plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are essentially factories for the production of interferons. These cells are found mainly in the blood and lymphoid tissue and they produce around x1000 more interferons than an average cell (all cells are capable of producing IFNs). IFNs are produced in response to a cells PRRs being activated. They travel to neighbouring cells and induce upregulate the transcription of the Interferon Stimulated Genes which work to suppress viral entry and replication and create and 'anti-viral state'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>NK cells are recruited by IL-12 (released after stimulation of PRRs) and activated by IFNs to kill virally infected cells. Virally infected cells express ligands on their surface that match the activating receptor on NK cells. NK killing of cells buys time for the adaptive immune response to be mounted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CD8+ cells are cytotoxic T cells. They require two signals from cDCs to be activated: one from MHC-I/peptide interacting with TCR, another from B7 on cDC interacting with CD28.

The poliovirus has been specially grown in such a manner that is in a weakened (attenuated) state. This means that even though the virus is live, it is safe for human applications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The OPV was developed after the IPV. The oral vaccine is extremely effective because it is a live, attenuated strain. Live viruses confer more lasting immunity because they act like an actual infection, stimulating more of the immune system than an inactivated alternative would. While the IPV stimulates IgG &ndash;mediated immunity (based on the production of the IgG antibody), the OPV stimulates the entire immune response. This is why a single dose of OPV can provide lasting immunity, while <strong>multiple booster shots of IPV are needed to maintain immunity against the condition.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The IPV provides varied protection against each main strain</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The OPV works by providing its immunity in the intestines, which is where poliovirus makes its way into the body. In contrast IPV works by largely preventing the effects of the virus on the nervous system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The OPV is still used in parts of the world where poliovirus is endemic (still regularly affecting the population): the three countries are Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. In these locations the protection offered by the OPV is needed to reduce the transmission of the disease and protect communities as a whole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the UK the OPV is no longer part of routine childhood immunisation. This is because live viruses carry with them some risks, which while acceptable where the disease is widespread and a major concern, are more of a concern where transmission of polio is almost negligible. Here in the UK IPV is used routinely as polio has been eliminated from the country, and has proven highly effective. We still vaccinate as we are at risk of an outbreak from some travelling into the UK from a region where it is endemic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The major concern with live vaccines like OPV is the risk of reversion</strong>. This is a phenomenon that occurs when an attenuated virus undergoes a change in its genetic material which makes it virulent. For some infections, this isn't as worrying, but with polio it can lead to paralysis. While the chances of this are very small, it is still a concern, which is why IPV is widely used in countries where polio infection has been dramatically reduced in the wider population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>OPVs are still sometimes provided as travel vaccines for adults travelling to parts of the world where the transmission of the disease is still a concern.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Vaccinations, Virology, case 9"

The consensual light reflex is similar but it is when the opposite pupil restricts in response to light. This happens because some nerve fibres cross at the optic chiasm.

A mutation in these pathways can reduce the signalling of apoptosis signals, allowing the cell to resist death.</span></p><p><span style=""display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">B (Insensitivity to anti-growth signals) - Mutations can inhibit tumour suppressor genes, allowing growth to continue unregulated. For example, RB is a protein made by a tumour suppressor gene. It is phosphorylated by cyclin dependent kinases that have been activated by cyclin D and this causes it to release transcription factors that produce cyclin E (essential for progression to the next stage of the cell cycle) and other proteins for DNA replication. It regulates cell division so when mutated to become inactive growth can continue unregulated.</span></p><p><span style=""display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">C (Limitless replicative potential) - Most cells are only able to reproduce a limited number of times (around 60 times &ndash; the Hayflick limit) before their telomeres are too short. Stem cells overcome this by producing telomerase which restores the telomeres. Cancer cells also produce telomerase, allowing them to reproduce indefinitely.</span></p><p>D (Self-sufficiency in growth signals) - Mitogens are factors that promote cell division. They are often growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) or platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). The mitogens will bind to a receptor on the cell surface and activate a signalling cascade that involves many proteins. The receptor and proteins involved in the signalling cascade are coded for by oncogenes and mutations in these can cause them to become over-active and allow the cancer to divide independently of external growth factors.</p><p>E (Sustained angiogenesis) - Low oxygen is sensed by a transcription factor (HIF), which increases the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

The injury results in cell death or detachment from the basement membrane, causing tubular dysfunction.<br />The exact pathological mechanisms are unknown, however, systemic hypotension, vasoconstrictors, increased nitric oxide, cytokines, endotoxins and free radicals may all be contributary. Its clinical course can be divided into three steps &ndash; the initiation, maintenance and recovery phase:<br />&bull; Initiation<br />o The injury to the tubular epithelial cells caused by ischaemia or nephrotoxins is evolving but not yet established. As the dysfunction progresses, cell death and detachment from the basement membrane cause tubular necrosis that reduces blood volume and renal perfusion. There is an acute decrease in GFR to low levels, with a sudden increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations.<br />o ATN possibly reversible at this point<br />&bull; Maintenance<br />o Renal injury is established. Endothelial cell necrosis and sloughing lead to tubular obstruction and increased tubular permeability. There is a sustained severe reduction in GFR. Creatinine and urea continue to rise, and oliguria may be present. Reduction in the nephron&rsquo;s ability to eliminate waste results in azotaemia, fluid retention, electrolyte imbalance and metabolic acidosis.<br />o This phase can last several days to months<br />o Oliguria and a prolonged maintenance phase are signs of poor renal prognosis<br />&bull; Recovery phase<br />o Patients recover renal function through repair and regeneration of renal tissue. Tubular function is restored and is characterised by an increase in urine volume and a decrease in urea and serum creatinine to pre-insult levels<br />Risk factors include:<br />&bull; Underlying renal disease<br />o Such as acute kidney injury or acute renal failure<br />&bull; Low renal perfusion<br />o This can occur with cold ischaemia during renal transplantation, renal surgery or renal artery thrombosis, leading to ischaemic injury and then ATN<br />&bull; Diabetes mellitus<br />&bull; Hypotension<br />o Associated with low renal perfusion<br />&bull; Excessive fluid loss<br />o From haemorrhage, GI tract, sweating or burns<br />&bull; Major surgery<br />o Decreased renal perfusion<br />&bull; Cardiac arrest<br />o Decreases the blood pressure<br />&bull; Mechanical ventilation<br />&bull; Exposure to nephrotoxins like NSAID&rsquo;s or radiocontrast media<br />&bull; Muscle trauma<br />&bull; Haemolysis<br />&bull; Hyperuricaemia<br />&bull; Infection<br />&bull; Advanced age<br />&bull; Multiple myeloma<br />&bull; Sepsis<br />o Systemic vasodilation that results in a decrease in blood supply to the kidneys due to lower blood pressure<br />&bull; Pancreatitis<br />o Systemic vasodilation that results in a decrease in blood supply to the kidneys due to lower blood pressure<br />On presentation and examination, the following features may become apparent:<br />&bull; Oliguria and anuria<br />&bull; Hypotension<br />&bull; Tachycardia<br />&bull; Poor oral intake and anorexia<br />&bull; Malaise<br />When investigation takes place, the following may be observed:<br />&bull; Basic metabolic profile (including creatinine and urea)<br />o Elevated creatinine, urea, hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis can all suggest ATN<br />&bull; 10:1 or higher urea to creatinine ratio<br />&bull; Elevated urine sodium concentration<br />&bull; Cell casts or muddy brown casts<br />&bull; Anaemia<br />There is no specific therapy for ATN apart from supportive care in maintaining volume status (crystalloids are preferably used or blood for haemorrhage) and controlling electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities. Nephrotoxins should preferably be ceased, and the underlying cause should be treated.<br />As a result of the ATN, patients are at risk of anaemia, hyperkalaemia, which can result in ECG abnormalities, and metabolic acidosis. They are also at risk of end stage renal disease.<br />Here is the reason for the hyperkalaemia (remember, AKI is linked to ATN). This mostly happens when the DCT and collecting duct are involved. This damages cells responsible for potassium excretion. This can happen due to ischaemia from ATN or from toxins. As it is acute AKI, there is not enough time for the body to stop the harmful effects of hyperkalaemia or compensate for it. Hyperkalaemia can cause the potassium hydrogen exchange, causing acidosis.</p>","Kidney"

It is characterised by the presence of circulating autoantibodies with a high serum globulin concentration, inflammatory changes on liver histology and a favourable response to immunosuppressive treatment.<br />There are 2 types, each with different antibodies.<br />Risk factors<br />&bull; Female gender<br />o In type 1, 78% are women and in type 2, 90-95% are female under the age of 40. More treatable, with 80% of patients responding to immunosuppressants.<br />&bull; Children<br />o Most likely group of people to get type 2, more commonly becomes cirrhosis and it is less treatable.<br />&bull; Genetic pre-disposition<br />&bull; Immune dysregulation<br />o The patient having other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes or ulcerative colitis puts them at a higher risk<br />Presentation and examination<br />&bull; Fatigue and malaise<br />&bull; Anorexia<br />&bull; Abdominal discomfort<br />o The pain would be very unlikely to fluctuate<br />&bull; Hepatomegaly<br />&bull; Jaundice<br />&bull; Mild pruritis<br />&bull; Arthralgia of small joints<br />&bull; Nausea<br />&bull; Fever<br />&bull; Spider nevi<br />Investigations<br />Serum bilirubin, AST, ALP and ALT are usually raised.<br />In type 1, there are also positive auto-antibodies &ndash; anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) are positive in 80% of patients. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are positive in 10% of patients. There is increased IgG in post patients. 25% of these patients have cirrhosis at presentation but 80% respond to immunosuppression.<br />In type 2, typically anti-liver/kidney microsomal type 1 (LKM1) autoantibodies. Positive ASMA and negative ANA.<br />Pathophysiology<br />It is believed that in a genetically pre-disposed person, an environmental agent can trigger a pathogenic process leading to liver necrosis and fibrosis.<br />Autoantigens have been implicated in the initiation of the cascade of events in this pathology.<br />If environmental agents are involved in triggering it, then molecular mimicry may come into play.<br />Most of the evidence supports a central role for an alteration in T-cell function, and there may also be B cell dysfunction.<br />Management<br />In mild conditions that are asymptomatic, patients are observed and monitored.<br />However, if the patient is symptomatic, the patient may be considered for immunosuppressant therapy consisting of prednisolone.<br />Cirrhosis may develop, and if the cirrhosis becomes decompensated or the patient doesn&rsquo;t respond to the prednisolone, the patient is put on the transplant list.<br />Complications and prognosis<br />Long term corticosteroid therapy are likely to develop osteoporosis and may also become obese. It is likely they will also develop a cosmetic defect.<br />If children are given the corticosteroids, they may develop a growth impairment.<br />Due to the immunosuppressant therapy, they may develop infections.<br />If left untreated, it has a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of 50% and a 10-year survival rate of 10%.

This is because serious complications may arise, such as sepsis, cerebral oedema, haemodynamic instability and renal failure.<br />Certain patients will be assessed for transplant.<br />Avoid drugs that constipate the individual as this can increase the risk of encephalopathy.<br />If ascites develops, restrict fluid, low salt diet, weigh daily and diuretics.<br />If cerebral oedema develops, mannitol and hyperventilation is given.<br />If encephalopathy (patient is confused and acting strangely), avoid sedatives.<br />Encephalopathy develops due to an increase of nitrogenous waste in the blood. It can be graded by severity:<br />&bull; Grade I<br />o Altered mood/behaviour, sleep disturbance, dyspraxia, poor arithmetic &ndash; no liver flap<br />&bull; Grade II<br />o Increasing drowsiness, confusion, slurred speech, inappropriate behaviour/personality change (ask the family) with or without liver flap.<br />&bull; Grade II<br />o Incoherent, restless, liver flap, stupor<br />&bull; Grade IV<br />o Coma<br />Complications and prognosis<br />Cerebral oedema is one of the main causes of mortality in these patients.<br />Patients are also at risk of acute renal failure.<br />Acute liver failure generally carries a substantial risk of mortality and continues to be a major challenge.

This results in osteomalacia and coagulopathy.<br />Management<br />Symptomatic treatment is given for the pruritis and diarrhoea the patient may experience.<br />For early stage disease, a bile acid analogue such as ursodeoxycholic acid is given. This is for fat-soluble vitamin prophylaxis. It can improve survival and reduce need for a liver transplant.<br />If the patient has a significant inflammatory component to their disease, immunomodulatory therapy is given, such as prednisolone.<br />If the patient is developing end stage liver disease, they are considered for liver transplant.<br />Complications and Prognosis<br />Osteomalacia and coagulopathy (as explained above).<br />One of the main complications is hypercholesterolaemia. In these cases, statins are safe to be given.<br />This disease is slowly progressive in the majority of patients. As people get it at an older age, they normally die of other causes before reaching end stage liver disease.</p>","gastroenterology, liver disease"

The right ventricle here is tiny due to compression and the amount of pressure.<br />Pathophysiology<br />Pericardial pressures are elevated because of accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space. The ventricular diastolic, right atrial and wedge pressures all rise to equal pericardial pressures in an attempt to prevent chamber collapse. This equalisation of pressures is the haemodynamic hallmark of tamponade. Once the pericardial pressure exceeds the intra-chamber pressures, the chamber will collapse.<br />Management<br />If the patient just has a pericardial effusion, it may resolve spontaneously or after NSAID or colchicine treatment.<br />With cardiac tamponade, you can give a fluid bolus to increase the preload in an attempt to overcome the pressure from the tamponade.<br />A needle aspiration of the pericardial sac must be done, ideally with ECG monitoring. This is done with a pericardiocentesis kit, which is a massive needle on the end of a big syringe. The needle is placed a few centimetres below the xiphoid sternum pointed towards the left shoulder, and you insert the needle, aspirating all the way until you start aspirating fluid. An echo must be done at the same time. If however large volumes start coming, you are probably in a ventricle and you must pull back. This is a treatment for non-traumatic cardiac tamponade.<br />In traumatic cardiac tamponade, the fluid that is surrounding the heart is blood and it will start to clot. Clot is solid and clot cannot be pulled out through pericardiocentesis.<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEnX8bVcsrI&amp;has_verified=1<br />If the patient arrests, you need to remove the pericardial fluid as quick as possible.

It is the most common genetic heart disease as well as the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death in young people. Sometimes, it is misdiagnosed as hypertensive heart disease.<br />Risk factors<br />A family history of HCM or sudden cardiac death is the only strong risk factor.<br />Presentation and Examination<br />Many patients will have no symptoms at the time of diagnosis and will be diagnosed following routine examination or family screening of an affected family member.<br />&bull; History of pre-syncope or syncope<br />&bull; Systolic ejection murmur<br />&bull; Left ventricular lift/parasternal heave<br />&bull; Double apical impulse or double carotid pulsation<br />o This is a second impulse that is usually not palpable, and it represents left ventricular filling during diastole. However, in states of an elevated end-diastolic pressure, such as in hypertrophy, it will be palpable. https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=jhUgnuVe_jU&amp;feature=emb_logo<br />&bull; Younger male (&lt;50 years)<br />&bull; Dyspnoea<br />o Present in 90% of those patients who are symptomatic, and is due to left ventricular outflow obstruction, diastolic dysfunction or end stage heart failure as a result of HCM.<br />&bull; Angina<br />o Present in 75% of those patients who are symptomatic, and is due to massive hypertrophy with impaired coronary perfusion<br />&bull; Palpitations<br />o May represent ventricular arrhythmia or atrial fibrillation<br />&bull; Irregularly irregular pulse<br />o Sign of atrial fibrillation<br />Investigation<br />&bull; ECG<br />o The most common ECG abnormality is that of abnormal ST or T waves and may include ST depression or giant T wave inversion. Prominent Q waves are also seen in some leads<br />&bull; Chest X-ray<br />o Not incredibly sensitive but it could show cardiomegaly<br />&bull; Echocardiography<br />o This is usually diagnostic and is used in family screening of an affected individual. It will show left ventricular and septal hypertrophy, a reduced ejection fraction and outflow obstruction</p><p>When the myocardium is hypertrophied in any condition, there is a larger mass of myocardium for electrical impulses to pass through and thus the amplitude of the QRS complex is increased.<br />Also, when the myocardium is abnormally thickened, the electrical activity takes longer to transverse throughout the whole heart and so the duration of the QRS complex may be widened. The T wave may be affected by similar mechanisms.<br />Sometimes, these repolarisation abnormalities can mimic ischaemic ST changes, and distinguishing them from an MI is important and often difficult.<br />Pathophysiology<br />Presence of one of the responsible genetic mutations leads to septal thickening from myocyte hypertrophy as well as an abnormal, thickened, disorganised collagen matrix. Septal hypertrophy may be diffuse or localised to one particular location of the septum. In the most classic form, hypertrophy is most marked in the septum immediately below the aortic valve. This may lead to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, which may be confined to the mid-cavity of the left ventricle.<br />Increased obstruction will occur in response to an increase in heart rate, myocardial contractility, reduced ventricular volume and peripheral vasodilation.<br />Myocardial ischaemia is common and likely to be multifactorial in origin. It may be due to an increased myocardial oxygen demand and reduced myocardial capillary density relative to the left ventricular hypertrophy.</p><p>Management<br />Asymptomatic patients are told that they must refrain from high-intensity athletics. However, asymptomatic patients who are also at high risk of sudden death must have an ICD fitted. Patients are considered to be at high risk of cardiac death if they have:<br />&bull; Family history of sudden death<br />&bull; Personal history of unexplained syncope<br />&bull; Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia<br />&bull; Abnormal blood pressure response to exercise, defined as a rise in systolic BP of &lt;20mmHg, no rise, or a fall in BP of &gt;20mmHg during exercise<br />&bull; Massive hypertrophy, with a left ventricular wall thickness of over 30mm<br />&bull; Severe outflow obstruction<br />&bull; Prior cardiac arrest, or sustained ventricular tachycardia<br />Symptomatic patients are given these as well as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. Vasodilators are avoided as it could make it worse.<br />In more severe cases, either surgical therapy or alcohol septal ablation is carried out.<br />Alcohol surgical ablation (mostly only used in this condition) involves the delivery of alcohol into a target septal perforator branch of the left anterior coronary artery for the purpose of producing an MI and reducing the septal thickness.<br />Surgical therapy involves resection of the septal myocardium to reduce obstruction.<br />Prognosis<br />Patients are at high risk of atrial arrhythmias</p>","Cardiology, Cardiovascular system, case 4"

This would occur 1-2 weeks after he was initially infected and commonly presents with a sore throat. It presents with proteinuria, Low C3 levels, and IgM, IgG and C3 deposition in the glomeruli. The reason his GFR has dropped is that this has gone on to cause nephritic syndrome (Post-Strep Glomerulonephritis is a common cause of Nephritic syndrome) It causes disruption of ENDOthelium in capillaries and you can find cellular casts in the urine.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>C - EPIthelial damage is a sign of Nephrotic syndrome.

She is 28 weeks pregnant and has a BMI of 37. She smoked up until 18 weeks of pregnancy and now takes nicotine gum. This is her first pregnancy. The consultant asks you what the most probable cause of her presentation is. You reply with...</p>","<p>Her age - she is over 42 years old which increases her risk</p>","<p>Her BMI - Her BMI shows that she is obese. This increases the risk of her getting fatty deposits building up in her arteries. Leukocytes migrate to this area where there is a fatty streak. Monocytes engulf the oxidised LDL forming foam cells. A fibrous capsule eventually forms. The plaque grows into the lumen which obstructs blood flow causing her to have high blood pressure and present with her symptoms.</p>","<p>Nicotine Gum - Chewing the nicotine causes a stronger and greater release of nicotine into the bloodstream. This is able to spread through the placenta causing vasoconstriction thus causing her symptoms&nbsp;</p>","<p>Incomplete modelling of spiral arteries and incomplete dissociation of cytotrophoblasts - causes low flow uteroplacental circulation increases her blood pressure and causing hypoxia&nbsp;</p>","<p>Her gestational progression - She is over 20 weeks pregnant which puts her at a high risk of these symptoms&nbsp;</p>","<p>The correct answer is D :) - This is the only CAUSE of Pre-Eclampsia which is what Becky is suffering with. The other factors are risk factors.</p><p>Pre-eclampsia occurs due to placental disease as a result of trophoblastic disorder. As explained in option D there is incomplete remodelling of spiral arteries and so low flow uteroplacental circulation.

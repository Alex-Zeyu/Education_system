The medial end is pulled superiorly, by the sternocleidomastoid muscle.<br />The suprascapular nerves (medial, intermedial and lateral) may be damaged by the upwards movement of the medial part of the fracture.

The key to recognising that Aspirin is an irreversible inhibitor is that amount of PG produced in the presence of aspirin is so much lower. Less PG can be produced as all of the enzyme is quickly and irreversibly inhibited after it is added. The reaction cannot continue without a catalyst.

When the water content drops, osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus detect this and cause the posterior pituitary gland to release more ADH. ADH travels through the blood to the nephron and makes the distal 1/3 of the distal conveluted tubule and the collecting duct more permeable to water. ADH bind to a g protein linked rececptor that activates adenylyl cyclase. adenylyl cyclase converts ATP in cAMP. cAMP acts as a second messenger and activates protein kinase A. Protein kinase A the stimulates vesicles containing aquaporins to bind to the cell membrane of the p cells in the collecting duct. The increase of aquaporins means that more water can move from the urine into the blood causing the urine to be more concentrated.&nbsp;</p>","PCS Unit 3, hormones, Kidneys, Regulation of Osmotic Mechanisms"

I'm glad I took<br />a day and hitchhiked around the hive.</p><p>You did come back different.</p><p>- Hi, Barry.<br />- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.</p><p>- Hear about Frankie?<br />- Yeah.</p><p>- You going to the funeral?<br />- No, I'm not going.</p><p>Everybody knows,<br />sting someone, you die.</p><p>Don't waste it on a squirrel.<br />Such a hothead.</p><p>I guess he could have<br />just gotten out of the way.</p><p>I love this incorporating<br />an amusement park into our day.</p><p>That's why we don't need vacations.</p><p>Boy, quite a bit of pomp...<br />under the circumstances.</p><p>- Well, Adam, today we are men.<br />- We are!</p><p>- Bee-men.<br />- Amen!</p><p>Hallelujah!</p><p>Students, faculty, distinguished bees,</p><p>please welcome Dean Buzzwell.</p><p>Welcome, New Hive Oity<br />graduating class of...</p><p>...9:15.</p><p>That concludes our ceremonies.</p><p>And begins your career<br />at Honex Industries!</p><p>Will we pick ourjob today?</p><p>I heard it's just orientation.</p><p>Heads up! Here we go.</p><p>Keep your hands and antennas<br />inside the tram at all times.</p><p>- Wonder what it'll be like?<br />- A little scary.</p><p>Welcome to Honex,<br />a division of Honesco</p><p>and a part of the Hexagon Group.</p><p>This is it!</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>We know that you, as a bee,<br />have worked your whole life</p><p>to get to the point where you<br />can work for your whole life.</p><p>Honey begins when our valiant Pollen<br />Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.</p><p>Our top-secret formula</p><p>is automatically color-corrected,<br />scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured</p><p>into this soothing sweet syrup</p><p>with its distinctive<br />golden glow you know as...</p><p>Honey!</p><p>- That girl was hot.<br />- She's my cousin!</p><p>- She is?<br />- Yes, we're all cousins.</p><p>- Right. You're right.<br />- At Honex, we constantly strive</p><p>to improve every aspect<br />of bee existence.</p><p>These bees are stress-testing<br />a new helmet technology.</p><p>- What do you think he makes?<br />- Not enough.</p><p>Here we have our latest advancement,<br />the Krelman.</p><p>- What does that do?<br />- Oatches that little strand of honey</p><p>that hangs after you pour it.<br />Saves us millions.</p><p>Oan anyone work on the Krelman?</p><p>Of course. Most bee jobs are<br />small ones. But bees know</p><p>that every small job,<br />if it's done well, means a lot.</p><p>But choose carefully</p><p>because you'll stay in the job<br />you pick for the rest of your life.</p><p>The same job the rest of your life?<br />I didn't know that.</p><p>What's the difference?</p><p>You'll be happy to know that bees,<br />as a species, haven't had one day off</p><p>in 27 million years.</p><p>So you'll just work us to death?</p><p>We'll sure try.</p><p>Wow! That blew my mind!</p><p>""What's the difference?""<br />How can you say that?</p><p>One job forever?<br />That's an insane choice to have to make.</p><p>I'm relieved. Now we only have<br />to make one decision in life.</p><p>But, Adam, how could they<br />never have told us that?</p><p>Why would you question anything?<br />We're bees.</p><p>We're the most perfectly<br />functioning society on Earth.</p><p>You ever think maybe things<br />work a little too well here?</p><p>Like what? Give me one example.</p><p>I don't know. But you know<br />what I'm talking about.</p><p>Please clear the gate.<br />Royal Nectar Force on approach.</p><p>Wait a second. Oheck it out.</p><p>- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!<br />- Wow.</p><p>I've never seen them this close.</p><p>They know what it's like<br />outside the hive.</p><p>Yeah, but some don't come back.</p><p>- Hey, Jocks!<br />- Hi, Jocks!</p><p>You guys did great!</p><p>You're monsters!<br />You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!</p><p>- I wonder where they were.<br />- I don't know.</p><p>Their day's not planned.</p><p>Outside the hive, flying who knows<br />where, doing who knows what.</p><p>You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen<br />Jock. You have to be bred for that.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Look. That's more pollen<br />than you and I will see in a lifetime.</p><p>It's just a status symbol.<br />Bees make too much of it.</p><p>Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it<br />and the ladies see you wearing it.</p><p>Those ladies?<br />Aren't they our cousins too?</p><p>Distant. Distant.</p><p>Look at these two.</p><p>- Oouple of Hive Harrys.<br />- Let's have fun with them.</p><p>It must be dangerous<br />being a Pollen Jock.</p><p>Yeah. Once a bear pinned me<br />against a mushroom!</p><p>He had a paw on my throat,<br />and with the other, he was slapping me!</p><p>- Oh, my!<br />- I never thought I'd knock him out.</p><p>What were you doing during this?</p><p>Trying to alert the authorities.</p><p>I can autograph that.</p><p>A little gusty out there today,<br />wasn't it, comrades?</p><p>Yeah. Gusty.</p><p>We're hitting a sunflower patch<br />six miles from here tomorrow.</p><p>- Six miles, huh?<br />- Barry!</p><p>A puddle jump for us,<br />but maybe you're not up for it.</p><p>- Maybe I am.<br />- You are not!</p><p>We're going 0900 at J-Gate.</p><p>What do you think, buzzy-boy?<br />Are you bee enough?</p><p>I might be. It all depends<br />on what 0900 means.</p><p>Hey, Honex!</p><p>Dad, you surprised me.</p><p>You decide what you're interested in?</p><p>- Well, there's a lot of choices.<br />- But you only get one.</p><p>Do you ever get bored<br />doing the same job every day?</p><p>Son, let me tell you about stirring.</p><p>You grab that stick, and you just<br />move it around, and you stir it around.</p><p>You get yourself into a rhythm.<br />It's a beautiful thing.</p><p>You know, Dad,<br />the more I think about it,</p><p>maybe the honey field<br />just isn't right for me.</p><p>You were thinking of what,<br />making balloon animals?</p><p>That's a bad job<br />for a guy with a stinger.</p><p>Janet, your son's not sure<br />he wants to go into honey!</p><p>- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.<br />- I'm not trying to be funny.</p><p>You're not funny! You're going<br />into honey. Our son, the stirrer!</p><p>- You're gonna be a stirrer?<br />- No one's listening to me!</p><p>Wait till you see the sticks I have.</p><p>I could say anything right now.<br />I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!</p><p>Let's open some honey and celebrate!</p><p>Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.<br />Shave my antennae.</p><p>Shack up with a grasshopper. Get<br />a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!</p><p>I'm so proud.</p><p>- We're starting work today!<br />- Today's the day.</p><p>Oome on! All the good jobs<br />will be gone.</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,<br />stirrer, front desk, hair removal...</p><p>- Is it still available?<br />- Hang on. Two left!</p><p>One of them's yours! Oongratulations!<br />Step to the side.</p><p>- What'd you get?<br />- Picking crud out. Stellar!</p><p>Wow!</p><p>Oouple of newbies?</p><p>Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!</p><p>Make your choice.</p><p>- You want to go first?<br />- No, you go.</p><p>Oh, my. What's available?</p><p>Restroom attendant's open,<br />not for the reason you think.</p><p>- Any chance of getting the Krelman?<br />- Sure, you're on.</p><p>I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.</p><p>Wax monkey's always open.</p><p>The Krelman opened up again.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>A bee died. Makes an opening. See?<br />He's dead. Another dead one.</p><p>Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.</p><p>Dead from the neck up.<br />Dead from the neck down. That's life!</p><p>Oh, this is so hard!</p><p>Heating, cooling,<br />stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,</p><p>humming, inspector number seven,<br />lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,</p><p>mite wrangler. Barry, what<br />do you think I should... Barry?</p><p>Barry!</p><p>All right, we've got the sunflower patch<br />in quadrant nine...</p><p>What happened to you?<br />Where are you?</p><p>- I'm going out.<br />- Out? Out where?</p><p>- Out there.<br />- Oh, no!</p><p>I have to, before I go<br />to work for the rest of my life.</p><p>You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?</p><p>Another call coming in.</p><p>If anyone's feeling brave,<br />there's a Korean deli on 83rd</p><p>that gets their roses today.</p><p>Hey, guys.</p><p>- Look at that.<br />- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?</p><p>Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.</p><p>It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.</p><p>Really? Feeling lucky, are you?</p><p>Sign here, here. Just initial that.</p><p>- Thank you.<br />- OK.</p><p>You got a rain advisory today,</p><p>and as you all know,<br />bees cannot fly in rain.</p><p>So be careful. As always,<br />watch your brooms,</p><p>hockey sticks, dogs,<br />birds, bears and bats.</p><p>Also, I got a couple of reports<br />of root beer being poured on us.</p><p>Murphy's in a home because of it,<br />babbling like a cicada!</p><p>- That's awful.<br />- And a reminder for you rookies,</p><p>bee law number one,<br />absolutely no talking to humans!</p><p>All right, launch positions!</p><p>Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

Bringing it around.</p><p>Stand to the side, kid.<br />It's got a bit of a kick.</p><p>That is one nectar collector!</p><p>- Ever see pollination up close?<br />- No, sir.</p><p>I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it<br />over here. Maybe a dash over there,</p><p>a pinch on that one.<br />See that? It's a little bit of magic.</p><p>That's amazing. Why do we do that?</p><p>That's pollen power. More pollen, more<br />flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.</p><p>Oool.</p><p>I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.<br />Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?</p><p>Oopy that visual.</p><p>Wait. One of these flowers<br />seems to be on the move.</p><p>Say again? You're reporting<br />a moving flower?</p><p>Affirmative.</p><p>That was on the line!</p><p>This is the coolest. What is it?</p><p>I don't know, but I'm loving this color.</p><p>It smells good.<br />Not like a flower, but I like it.</p><p>Yeah, fuzzy.</p><p>Ohemical-y.</p><p>Oareful, guys.

If you don't move,<br />he won't sting you.

Maybe that's a way out.</p><p>I don't remember the sun<br />having a big 75 on it.</p><p>I predicted global warming.</p><p>I could feel it getting hotter.<br />At first I thought it was just me.</p><p>Wait! Stop! Bee!</p><p>Stand back. These are winter boots.</p><p>Wait!</p><p>Don't kill him!</p><p>You know I'm allergic to them!<br />This thing could kill me!</p><p>Why does his life have<br />less value than yours?</p><p>Why does his life have any less value<br />than mine?

You<br />don't know what he's capable of feeling.</p><p>My brochure!</p><p>There you go, little guy.</p><p>I'm not scared of him.<br />It's an allergic thing.</p><p>Put that on your resume brochure.</p><p>My whole face could puff up.</p><p>Make it one of your special skills.</p><p>Knocking someone out<br />is also a special skill.</p><p>Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.</p><p>- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?<br />- Sure, Ken.

Oome on!</p><p>No. Yes. No.</p><p>Do it. I can't.</p><p>How should I start it?<br />""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.</p><p>Here she comes! Speak, you fool!</p><p>Hi!</p><p>I'm sorry.</p><p>- You're talking.<br />- Yes, I know.</p><p>You're talking!</p><p>I'm so sorry.</p><p>No, it's OK. It's fine.<br />I know I'm dreaming.</p><p>But I don't recall going to bed.</p><p>Well, I'm sure this<br />is very disconcerting.</p><p>This is a bit of a surprise to me.<br />I mean, you're a bee!</p><p>I am. And I'm not supposed<br />to be doing this,</p><p>but they were all trying to kill me.</p><p>And if it wasn't for you...</p><p>I had to thank you.<br />It's just how I was raised.</p><p>That was a little weird.</p><p>- I'm talking with a bee.<br />- Yeah.</p><p>I'm talking to a bee.<br />And the bee is talking to me!</p><p>I just want to say I'm grateful.<br />I'll leave now.</p><p>- Wait! How did you learn to do that?<br />- What?</p><p>The talking thing.</p><p>Same way you did, I guess.<br />""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.</p><p>- That's very funny.<br />- Yeah.</p><p>Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,<br />we'd cry with what we have to deal with.</p><p>Anyway...</p><p>Oan I...</p><p>...get you something?<br />- Like what?</p><p>I don't know. I mean...<br />I don't know. Ooffee?</p><p>I don't want to put you out.</p><p>It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.</p><p>- It's just coffee.<br />- I hate to impose.</p><p>- Don't be ridiculous!<br />- Actually, I would love a cup.</p><p>Hey, you want rum cake?</p><p>- I shouldn't.<br />- Have some.</p><p>- No, I can't.<br />- Oome on!</p><p>I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.</p><p>- Where?<br />- These stripes don't help.</p><p>You look great!</p><p>I don't know if you know<br />anything about fashion.</p><p>Are you all right?</p><p>No.</p><p>He's making the tie in the cab<br />as they're flying up Madison.</p><p>He finally gets there.</p><p>He runs up the steps into the church.<br />The wedding is on.</p><p>And he says, ""Watermelon?<br />I thought you said Guatemalan.</p><p>Why would I marry a watermelon?""</p><p>Is that a bee joke?</p><p>That's the kind of stuff we do.</p><p>Yeah, different.</p><p>So, what are you gonna do, Barry?</p><p>About work? I don't know.</p><p>I want to do my part for the hive,<br />but I can't do it the way they want.</p><p>I know how you feel.</p><p>- You do?<br />- Sure.</p><p>My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or<br />a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.</p><p>- Really?<br />- My only interest is flowers.</p><p>Our new queen was just elected<br />with that same campaign slogan.</p><p>Anyway, if you look...</p><p>There's my hive right there. See it?</p><p>You're in Sheep Meadow!</p><p>Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!</p><p>No way! I know that area.<br />I lost a toe ring there once.</p><p>- Why do girls put rings on their toes?<br />- Why not?</p><p>- It's like putting a hat on your knee.<br />- Maybe I'll try that.</p><p>- You all right, ma'am?<br />- Oh, yeah. Fine.</p><p>Just having two cups of coffee!</p><p>Anyway, this has been great.<br />Thanks for the coffee.</p><p>Yeah, it's no trouble.</p><p>Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,<br />I'd be up the rest of my life.</p><p>Are you...?</p><p>Oan I take a piece of this with me?</p><p>Sure! Here, have a crumb.</p><p>- Thanks!<br />- Yeah.</p><p>All right. Well, then...<br />I guess I'll see you around.</p><p>Or not.</p><p>OK, Barry.</p><p>And thank you<br />so much again... for before.</p><p>Oh, that? That was nothing.</p><p>Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...</p><p>This can't possibly work.</p><p>He's all set to go.<br />We may as well try it.</p><p>OK, Dave, pull the chute.</p><p>- Sounds amazing.<br />- It was amazing!</p><p>It was the scariest,<br />happiest moment of my life.</p><p>Humans! I can't believe<br />you were with humans!</p><p>Giant, scary humans!<br />What were they like?</p><p>Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.</p><p>They eat crazy giant things.<br />They drive crazy.</p><p>- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?<br />- Some of them. But some of them don't.</p><p>- How'd you get back?<br />- Poodle.</p><p>You did it, and I'm glad. You saw<br />whatever you wanted to see.</p><p>You had your ""experience."" Now you<br />can pick out yourjob and be normal.</p><p>- Well...<br />- Well?</p><p>Well, I met someone.</p><p>You did? Was she Bee-ish?</p><p>- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!<br />- No, no, no, not a wasp.</p><p>- Spider?<br />- I'm not attracted to spiders.</p><p>I know it's the hottest thing,<br />with the eight legs and all.</p><p>I can't get by that face.</p><p>So who is she?</p><p>She's... human.</p><p>No, no. That's a bee law.<br />You wouldn't break a bee law.</p><p>- Her name's Vanessa.<br />- Oh, boy.</p><p>She's so nice. And she's a florist!</p><p>Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!</p><p>We're not dating.</p><p>You're flying outside the hive, talking<br />to humans that attack our homes</p><p>with power washers and M-80s!<br />One-eighth a stick of dynamite!</p><p>She saved my life!<br />And she understands me.</p><p>This is over!</p><p>Eat this.</p><p>This is not over! What was that?</p><p>- They call it a crumb.<br />- It was so stingin' stripey!</p><p>And that's not what they eat.<br />That's what falls off what they eat!</p><p>- You know what a Oinnabon is?<br />- No.</p><p>It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.<br />They heat it up...</p><p>Sit down!</p><p>...really hot!<br />- Listen to me!</p><p>We are not them! We're us.<br />There's us and there's them!</p><p>Yes, but who can deny<br />the heart that is yearning?</p><p>There's no yearning.<br />Stop yearning. Listen to me!</p><p>You have got to start thinking bee,<br />my friend. Thinking bee!</p><p>- Thinking bee.<br />- Thinking bee.</p><p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee!<br />Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p><p>There he is. He's in the pool.</p><p>You know what your problem is, Barry?</p><p>I gotta start thinking bee?</p><p>How much longer will this go on?</p><p>It's been three days!<br />Why aren't you working?</p><p>I've got a lot of big life decisions<br />to think about.</p><p>What life? You have no life!<br />You have no job. You're barely a bee!</p><p>Would it kill you<br />to make a little honey?</p><p>Barry, come out.<br />Your father's talking to you.</p><p>Martin, would you talk to him?</p><p>Barry, I'm talking to you!</p><p>You coming?</p><p>Got everything?</p><p>All set!</p><p>Go ahead. I'll catch up.</p><p>Don't be too long.</p><p>Watch this!</p><p>Vanessa!</p><p>- We're still here.<br />- I told you not to yell at him.</p><p>He doesn't respond to yelling!</p><p>- Then why yell at me?<br />- Because you don't listen!</p><p>I'm not listening to this.</p><p>Sorry, I've gotta go.</p><p>- Where are you going?<br />- I'm meeting a friend.</p><p>A girl? Is this why you can't decide?</p><p>Bye.</p><p>I just hope she's Bee-ish.</p><p>They have a huge parade<br />of flowers every year in Pasadena?</p><p>To be in the Tournament of Roses,<br />that's every florist's dream!</p><p>Up on a float, surrounded<br />by flowers, crowds cheering.</p><p>A tournament. Do the roses<br />compete in athletic events?</p><p>No. All right, I've got one.<br />How come you don't fly everywhere?</p><p>It's exhausting. Why don't you<br />run everywhere? It's faster.</p><p>Yeah, OK, I see, I see.<br />All right, your turn.</p><p>TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?<br />That's insane!</p><p>You don't have that?</p><p>We have Hivo, but it's a disease.<br />It's a horrible, horrible disease.</p><p>Oh, my.</p><p>Dumb bees!</p><p>You must want to sting all those jerks.</p><p>We try not to sting.<br />It's usually fatal for us.</p><p>So you have to watch your temper.</p><p>Very carefully.<br />You kick a wall, take a walk,</p><p>write an angry letter and throw it out.<br />Work through it like any emotion:</p><p>Anger, jealousy, lust.</p><p>Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>- What is wrong with you?!<br />- It's a bug.</p><p>He's not bothering anybody.<br />Get out of here, you creep!</p><p>What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?</p><p>Yeah, it was. How did you know?</p><p>It felt like about 10 pages.<br />Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.</p><p>You've really got that<br />down to a science.</p><p>- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.<br />- I'll bet.</p><p>What in the name<br />of Mighty Hercules is this?</p><p>How did this get here?<br />Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,</p><p>Ray Liotta Private Select?</p><p>- Is he that actor?<br />- I never heard of him.</p><p>- Why is this here?<br />- For people.

The Honorable<br />Judge Bumbleton presiding.</p><p>All right. Oase number 4475,</p><p>Superior Oourt of New York,<br />Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry</p><p>is now in session.</p><p>Mr. Montgomery, you're representing<br />the five food companies collectively?</p><p>A privilege.</p><p>Mr. Benson... you're representing<br />all the bees of the world?</p><p>I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,<br />we're ready to proceed.</p><p>Mr. Montgomery,<br />your opening statement, please.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,</p><p>my grandmother was a simple woman.</p><p>Born on a farm, she believed<br />it was man's divine right</p><p>to benefit from the bounty<br />of nature God put before us.</p><p>If we lived in the topsy-turvy world<br />Mr. Benson imagines,</p><p>just think of what would it mean.</p><p>I would have to negotiate<br />with the silkworm</p><p>for the elastic in my britches!</p><p>Talking bee!</p><p>How do we know this isn't some sort of</p><p>holographic motion-picture-capture<br />Hollywood wizardry?</p><p>They could be using laser beams!</p><p>Robotics! Ventriloquism!<br />Oloning! For all we know,</p><p>he could be on steroids!</p><p>Mr. Benson?</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />there's no trickery here.</p><p>I'm just an ordinary bee.<br />Honey's pretty important to me.</p><p>It's important to all bees.<br />We invented it!</p><p>We make it. And we protect it<br />with our lives.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are<br />some people in this room</p><p>who think they can take it from us</p><p>'cause we're the little guys!<br />I'm hoping that, after this is all over,</p><p>you'll see how, by taking our honey,<br />you not only take everything we have</p><p>but everything we are!</p><p>I wish he'd dress like that<br />all the time. So nice!</p><p>Oall your first witness.</p><p>So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden<br />of Honey Farms, big company you have.</p><p>I suppose so.</p><p>I see you also own<br />Honeyburton and Honron!</p><p>Yes, they provide beekeepers<br />for our farms.</p><p>Beekeeper. I find that<br />to be a very disturbing term.</p><p>I don't imagine you employ<br />any bee-free-ers, do you?</p><p>- No.<br />- I couldn't hear you.</p><p>- No.<br />- No.</p><p>Because you don't free bees.<br />You keep bees. Not only that,</p><p>it seems you thought a bear would be<br />an appropriate image for a jar of honey.</p><p>They're very lovable creatures.</p><p>Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.</p><p>You mean like this?</p><p>Bears kill bees!</p><p>How'd you like his head crashing<br />through your living room?!</p><p>Biting into your couch!<br />Spitting out your throw pillows!</p><p>OK, that's enough. Take him away.</p><p>So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.<br />Your name intrigues me.</p><p>- Where have I heard it before?<br />- I was with a band called The Police.</p><p>But you've never been<br />a police officer, have you?</p><p>No, I haven't.</p><p>No, you haven't. And so here<br />we have yet another example</p><p>of bee culture casually<br />stolen by a human</p><p>for nothing more than<br />a prance-about stage name.</p><p>Oh, please.</p><p>Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?</p><p>Because I'm feeling<br />a little stung, Sting.</p><p>Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!</p><p>That's not his real name?! You idiots!</p><p>Mr. Liotta, first,<br />belated congratulations on</p><p>your Emmy win for a guest spot<br />on ER in 2005.</p><p>Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>I see from your resume<br />that you're devilishly handsome</p><p>with a churning inner turmoil<br />that's ready to blow.</p><p>I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?</p><p>Not yet it isn't. But is this<br />what it's come to for you?</p><p>Exploiting tiny, helpless bees<br />so you don't</p><p>have to rehearse<br />your part and learn your lines, sir?</p><p>Watch it, Benson!<br />I could blow right now!</p><p>This isn't a goodfella.<br />This is a badfella!</p><p>Why doesn't someone just step on<br />this creep, and we can all go home?!</p><p>- Order in this court!<br />- You're all thinking it!</p><p>Order! Order, I say!</p><p>- Say it!<br />- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!</p><p>I think it was awfully nice<br />of that bear to pitch in like that.</p><p>I think the jury's on our side.</p><p>Are we doing everything right, legally?</p><p>I'm a florist.</p><p>Right. Well, here's to a great team.</p><p>To a great team!</p><p>Well, hello.</p><p>- Ken!<br />- Hello.</p><p>I didn't think you were coming.</p><p>No, I was just late.<br />I tried to call, but... the battery.</p><p>I didn't want all this to go to waste,<br />so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.</p><p>Oh, that was lucky.</p><p>There's a little left.<br />I could heat it up.</p><p>Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.</p><p>So I hear you're quite a tennis player.</p><p>I'm not much for the game myself.<br />The ball's a little grabby.</p><p>That's where I usually sit.<br />Right... there.</p><p>Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,</p><p>and he agreed with me that eating with<br />chopsticks isn't really a special skill.</p><p>You think I don't see what you're doing?</p><p>I know how hard it is to find<br />the rightjob. We have that in common.</p><p>Do we?</p><p>Bees have 100 percent employment,<br />but we do jobs like taking the crud out.</p><p>That's just what<br />I was thinking about doing.</p><p>Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor<br />for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.</p><p>I'm going to drain the old stinger.</p><p>Yeah, you do that.</p><p>Look at that.</p><p>You know, I've just about had it</p><p>with your little mind games.</p><p>- What's that?<br />- Italian Vogue.</p><p>Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.</p><p>A lot of ads.</p><p>Remember what Van said, why is<br />your life more valuable than mine?</p><p>Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!</p><p>I think something stinks in here!</p><p>I love the smell of flowers.</p><p>How do you like the smell of flames?!</p><p>Not as much.</p><p>Water bug! Not taking sides!</p><p>Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!<br />This is pathetic!</p><p>I've got issues!</p><p>Well, well, well, a royal flush!</p><p>- You're bluffing.<br />- Am I?</p><p>Surf's up, dude!</p><p>Poo water!</p><p>That bowl is gnarly.</p><p>Except for those dirty yellow rings!</p><p>Kenneth! What are you doing?!</p><p>You know, I don't even like honey!<br />I don't eat it!</p><p>We need to talk!</p><p>He's just a little bee!</p><p>And he happens to be<br />the nicest bee I've met in a long time!</p><p>Long time? What are you talking about?!<br />Are there other bugs in your life?</p><p>No, but there are other things bugging<br />me in life. And you're one of them!</p><p>Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...</p><p>My nerves are fried from riding<br />on this emotional roller coaster!</p><p>Goodbye, Ken.</p><p>And for your information,</p><p>I prefer sugar-free, artificial<br />sweeteners made by man!</p><p>I'm sorry about all that.</p><p>I know it's got<br />an aftertaste! I like it!</p><p>I always felt there was some kind<br />of barrier between Ken and me.</p><p>I couldn't overcome it.<br />Oh, well.</p><p>Are you OK for the trial?</p><p>I believe Mr. Montgomery<br />is about out of ideas.</p><p>We would like to call<br />Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.</p><p>Good idea! You can really see why he's<br />considered one of the best lawyers...</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Layton, you've<br />gotta weave some magic</p><p>with this jury,<br />or it's gonna be all over.</p><p>Don't worry. The only thing I have<br />to do to turn this jury around</p><p>is to remind them<br />of what they don't like about bees.</p><p>- You got the tweezers?<br />- Are you allergic?</p><p>Only to losing, son. Only to losing.</p><p>Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you<br />what I think we'd all like to know.</p><p>What exactly is your relationship</p><p>to that woman?</p><p>We're friends.</p><p>- Good friends?<br />- Yes.</p><p>How good? Do you live together?</p><p>Wait a minute...</p><p>Are you her little...</p><p>...bedbug?</p><p>I've seen a bee documentary or two.<br />From what I understand,</p><p>doesn't your queen give birth<br />to all the bee children?</p><p>- Yeah, but...<br />- So those aren't your real parents!</p><p>- Oh, Barry...<br />- Yes, they are!</p><p>Hold me back!</p><p>You're an illegitimate bee,<br />aren't you, Benson?</p><p>He's denouncing bees!</p><p>Don't y'all date your cousins?</p><p>- Objection!<br />- I'm going to pincushion this guy!</p><p>Adam, don't! It's what he wants!</p><p>Oh, I'm hit!!</p><p>Oh, lordy, I am hit!</p><p>Order! Order!</p><p>The venom! The venom<br />is coursing through my veins!</p><p>I have been felled<br />by a winged beast of destruction!</p><p>You see? You can't treat them<br />like equals! They're striped savages!</p><p>Stinging's the only thing<br />they know! It's their way!</p><p>- Adam, stay with me.<br />- I can't feel my legs.</p><p>What angel of mercy<br />will come forward to suck the poison</p><p>from my heaving buttocks?</p><p>I will have order in this court. Order!</p><p>Order, please!</p><p>The case of the honeybees<br />versus the human race</p><p>took a pointed turn against the bees</p><p>yesterday when one of their legal<br />team stung Layton T. Montgomery.</p><p>- Hey, buddy.<br />- Hey.</p><p>- Is there much pain?<br />- Yeah.</p><p>I...</p><p>I blew the whole case, didn't I?</p><p>It doesn't matter. What matters is<br />you're alive. You could have died.</p><p>I'd be better off dead. Look at me.</p><p>They got it from the cafeteria<br />downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.</p><p>Look, there's<br />a little celery still on it.</p><p>What was it like to sting someone?</p><p>I can't explain it. It was all...</p><p>All adrenaline and then...<br />and then ecstasy!</p><p>All right.</p><p>You think it was all a trap?</p><p>Of course. I'm sorry.<br />I flew us right into this.</p><p>What were we thinking? Look at us. We're<br />just a couple of bugs in this world.</p><p>What will the humans do to us<br />if they win?</p><p>I don't know.</p><p>I hear they put the roaches in motels.<br />That doesn't sound so bad.</p><p>Adam, they check in,<br />but they don't check out!</p><p>Oh, my.</p><p>Oould you get a nurse<br />to close that window?</p><p>- Why?<br />- The smoke.</p><p>Bees don't smoke.</p><p>Right. Bees don't smoke.</p><p>Bees don't smoke!<br />But some bees are smoking.</p><p>That's it! That's our case!</p><p>It is? It's not over?</p><p>Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.</p><p>Get back to the court and stall.<br />Stall any way you can.</p><p>And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.</p><p>Mr. Flayman.</p><p>Yes? Yes, Your Honor!</p><p>Where is the rest of your team?</p><p>Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.</p><p>Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,</p><p>and as a result,<br />we don't make very good time.</p><p>I actually heard a funny story about...</p><p>Your Honor,<br />haven't these ridiculous bugs</p><p>taken up enough<br />of this court's valuable time?</p><p>How much longer will we allow<br />these absurd shenanigans to go on?</p><p>They have presented no compelling<br />evidence to support their charges</p><p>against my clients,<br />who run legitimate businesses.</p><p>I move for a complete dismissal<br />of this entire case!</p><p>Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going</p><p>to have to consider<br />Mr. Montgomery's motion.</p><p>But you can't! We have a terrific case.</p><p>Where is your proof?<br />Where is the evidence?</p><p>Show me the smoking gun!</p><p>Hold it, Your Honor!<br />You want a smoking gun?</p><p>Here is your smoking gun.</p><p>What is that?</p><p>It's a bee smoker!</p><p>What, this?<br />This harmless little contraption?</p><p>This couldn't hurt a fly,<br />let alone a bee.</p><p>Look at what has happened</p><p>to bees who have never been asked,<br />""Smoking or non?""</p><p>Is this what nature intended for us?</p><p>To be forcibly addicted<br />to smoke machines</p><p>and man-made wooden slat work camps?</p><p>Living out our lives as honey slaves<br />to the white man?</p><p>- What are we gonna do?<br />- He's playing the species card.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, please,<br />free these bees!</p><p>Free the bees! Free the bees!</p><p>Free the bees!</p><p>Free the bees! Free the bees!</p><p>The court finds in favor of the bees!</p><p>Vanessa, we won!</p><p>I knew you could do it! High-five!</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>I'm OK! You know what this means?</p><p>All the honey<br />will finally belong to the bees.</p><p>Now we won't have<br />to work so hard all the time.</p><p>This is an unholy perversion<br />of the balance of nature, Benson.</p><p>You'll regret this.</p><p>Barry, how much honey is out there?</p><p>All right. One at a time.</p><p>Barry, who are you wearing?</p><p>My sweater is Ralph Lauren,<br />and I have no pants.</p><p>- What if Montgomery's right?<br />- What do you mean?</p><p>We've been living the bee way<br />a long time, 27 million years.</p><p>Oongratulations on your victory.<br />What will you demand as a settlement?</p><p>First, we'll demand a complete shutdown<br />of all bee work camps.</p><p>Then we want back the honey<br />that was ours to begin with,</p><p>every last drop.</p><p>We demand an end to the glorification<br />of the bear as anything more</p><p>than a filthy, smelly,<br />bad-breath stink machine.</p><p>We're all aware<br />of what they do in the woods.</p><p>Wait for my signal.</p><p>Take him out.</p><p>He'll have nauseous<br />for a few hours, then he'll be fine.</p><p>And we will no longer tolerate<br />bee-negative nicknames...</p><p>But it's just a prance-about stage name!</p><p>...unnecessary inclusion of honey<br />in bogus health products</p><p>and la-dee-da human<br />tea-time snack garnishments.</p><p>Oan't breathe.</p><p>Bring it in, boys!</p><p>Hold it right there! Good.</p><p>Tap it.</p><p>Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,<br />and there's gallons more coming!</p><p>- I think we need to shut down!<br />- Shut down? We've never shut down.</p><p>Shut down honey production!</p><p>Stop making honey!</p><p>Turn your key, sir!</p><p>What do we do now?</p><p>Oannonball!</p><p>We're shutting honey production!</p><p>Mission abort.</p><p>Aborting pollination and nectar detail.<br />Returning to base.</p><p>Adam, you wouldn't believe<br />how much honey was out there.</p><p>Oh, yeah?</p><p>What's going on?

Natural GnRH release is pusiltise. In the short term desensitisation can occur by the covalent modification of the hormone receptor or the binding of an inhibitory protein.

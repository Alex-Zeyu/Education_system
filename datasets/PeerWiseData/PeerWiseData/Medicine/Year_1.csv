Whilst drinking a shake after a massive session of squats in the gym, he contemplates the process of digestion. He recalls that one of the enzymes involved in protein digestion (a proteolytic enzyme) in the stomach is pepsin and it's inactive precursor (zymogen) is pepsinogen. But he can't remember which cells in the stomach secrete pepsinogen. He asks a fellow medical student who knows everything as she uses PeerWise everyday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which cells does she tell him are responsible? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>","<p>chief cells</p>","<p>d cells</p>","<p>g&nbsp;cells</p>","<p>Leydig cells</p>","<p style=""padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"">parietal cells</p>","<p>Chief cells (found in the body of the stomach) are responsible for secretion of pepsinogen, which is converted into the active proteolytic enzyme pepsin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Consumption of protein stimulates the production of gastrin, secreted by G cells. Gastrin then stimulates the secretion of both intrinsic factor and hydrochloric acid from parietal cells. The hydrochloric acid catalyses the conversion of pesinogen to pepsin. The acidic environment created and pepsin are both important for the hydrolysis of proteins. Intrinsic factor is responsible for assisting absorption of vitamin B12 found in proteinaceous foods such as meat, fish and eggs. D cells (found in the antrum of the stomach) are stimulated by Gastrin and secrete somatostatin, a hormone which inhibits Gastrin excretion from G cells and hydrochloric acid from parietal cells (a negative feedback mechanism presenting the stomach becoming too acidic).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Leydig cells are testosterone producing cells found in the testicles. They are important for getting buff but have little direct influence on digestion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Random mnemonic: I remember that chief cells secrete pepsinogen and are found in the body of the stomach by picturing the image of a native American chief drinking pepsi, which goes into his body. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pepsi is the ancient Greek word for digestion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently the drink ""Pepsi"" is so named as it was initially marketed as a digestive aid (although the sources for this are dubious), other dubious sources claim that Pepsi is called Pepsi because Pepsin is involved or was involved in it's production (again, this is from dodgy internet sources, not necessarily true). The rest of the information in this question is true though!

The &ldquo;funny&rdquo; (If) current, originally described in sinoatrial node myocytes as an inward current activated on hyperpolarization to the diastolic range of voltages, has properties suitable for generating repetitive activity and for modulating spontaneous rate. The degree of activation of the funny current determines, at the end of an action potential, the steepness of phase 4 depolarization; hence, the frequency of action potential firing. Because If is controlled by intracellular cAMP and is thus activated and inhibited by &beta;-adrenergic and muscarinic M2 receptor stimulation, respectively, it represents a basic physiological mechanism mediating autonomic regulation of heart rate. Given the complexity of the cellular processes involved in rhythmic activity, an exact quantification of the extent to which If and other mechanisms contribute to pacemaking is still a debated issue; nonetheless, a wealth of information collected since the current was first described more than 30 years ago clearly agrees to identify If as a major player in both generation of spontaneous activity and rate control. If- dependent pacemaking has recently advanced from a basic, physiologically relevant concept, as originally described, to a practical concept that has several potentially useful clinical applications and can be valuable in therapeutically relevant conditions. Typically, given their exclusive role in pacemaking, f-channels are ideal targets of drugs aiming to pharmacological control of cardiac rate. Molecules able to bind specifically to and block f-channels can thus be used as pharmacological tools for heart rate reduction with little or no adverse cardiovascular side effects. Indeed a selective f-channel inhibitor, ivabradine, is today commercially available as a tool in the treatment of stable chronic angina. Also, several loss-of-function mutations of HCN4 (hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic-nucleotide gated 4), the major constitutive subunit of f-channels in pacemaker cells, are known today to cause rhythm disturbances, such as for example inherited sinus bradycardia. Finally, gene- or cell-based methods for in situ delivery of f-channels to silent or defective cardiac muscle represent novel approaches for the development of biological pacemakers eventually able to replace electronic devices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note: A balance between influx of Ca++ and efflux of K+ results in the plateau stage of the AV node.</p>","Cardiology, Cardiovascular System"

Circulating retinol-retinol binding protein complex is required in the formation of rhodopsin (which is cis-retinal bound to the vision protein opsin), a membrane protein of the rod cell photoreceptors in the retina. In response to light energy the cis-retinal in rhodopsin is converted to trans-retinal; the altered shape of the molecule triggers a nerve impulse from the retina<br />which is perceived as light in black and white vision. Cone cells, in contrast, are important for colour vision and for bright light vision; they contain retinal-based chromophores that respond to specific wavelengths of light. The immediate time after seeing a flash of bright light involves a period of active rhodopsin synthesis and requires a relatively high level of vitamin A in the retina. &ldquo;Night blindness&rdquo; is one of the first detectable signs of vitamin A deficiency. In this condition the blood supplying rod cells contains insufficient cis-retinal to rapidly replace the trans-retinal formed after exposure to bright light and the resulting condition is called night blindness. If unchecked, the next stage in this process is xeropthalmia, which occurs when the soft, lubricated membrane of the eye transforms into a dry, keratinised epithelium. Xeropthalmia results in total blindness and while this condition is not found in the UK population, it is a common cause of blindness in developing countries, particularly amongst children</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Biochemistry, Nutrition"

It indicates that this is a period of infertility and the thinning of cervical mucus is due to the Progesterone increase.</p>","<p>The cervical mucus appears as raw egg white during the period where ovulation is approaching. This is known as ""fertile mucus"". These changes are stimulated by an increase in LH and indicate ovulation.&nbsp;</p>","<p>The cervical mucus appears as raw egg white during the period where ovulation is approaching. The increase in Oestrogen pre-ovulation triggers these changes in the mucus until ""peak mucus day"". This cervical mucus consistency indicates a period of fertility where the mucus is thin and penetrable to sperm.&nbsp;</p>","<p>The cervical mucus is continuously thin and watery until day 14, after which it becomes scanty and thick until menstruation - this is when Katy detects raw egg white resembling discharge. The increasing temperature thickens the mucus post ovulation.&nbsp;</p>","","<p>A - Completely false - the cervical mucus&nbsp;resembles&nbsp;raw egg whites as a result to its increase in volume, fluidity and clarity in the period approaching ovulation - this is when it is thin. It is the rise in Oestrogen that stimulates these changes in the cervical mucus. Progesterone on the contrary is thought to increase the thickness of the cervical mucus thus decreasing fertility.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B - False: Oestrogen rises are the stimuli for the changes in the cervical mucus. There is a peak mucus day that correlates with the peak secretion of Oestrogen, and&nbsp;occurs approximately one day before the LH surge (max 48 hours). This is when the cervical mucus is at its most penetrable - the raw egg white consistency indicates a period of fertility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>C- This is the correct answer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>D- False - Again as in q.A with regards to timing of the raw egg white consistency. The temperature does increase post- ovulation and it is important to note this as it is also an important indicator used to determine whether in a period of fertility. I am unsure as to whether there is a relationship between the thickening of the mucus and the increase temperature, other than that they are both caused by the increase in Progesterone after ovulation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>""Just prior to ovulation, estrogen levels rise causing the cervix to swell and soften and the external os to dilate, allowing sperm better access to the uterus.4 Also during this time, the cervix secretes slippery, clear and stretchy mucus which exudes from the cervix into the vagina. This &lsquo;fertile mucus&rsquo; facilitates the ability of sperm to travel from the vagina into the uterus and can help keep sperm alive for up to five days. After ovulation, progesterone causes the cervix to harden, close, and secrete thicker, cloudy, (or opaque) mucus which acts as a plug, preventing bacteria and sperm from entering the uterus. Further, when this thick mucus is present, fertilization is very unlikely.""</p>","Sexual Health, Hormones, Physiology, reproductive system"

This condition is associated with decreased sperm count and low levels of inhibin. Inhibin is made in the seminiferous tubules and acts as a negative regulator of FSH.</p><p>In males who have gone through puberty, the scrotum is principally important in temperature regulation during spermatogenesis. The seminiferous tubules require a cooler environment &nbsp;than normal body temperature to produce sperm at optimum conditions. They can become damaged when &nbsp;exposed to normal body temperature in cryptorchidism, or possibly in trauma. Sperm count and inhibin levels are consequently decreased, therefore FSH levels will be high. This condition is usually managed surgically with orchidopexy, a surgery that moves undescended testicles into the scrotum and permanently fixes them there. Most diagnosed kids have this before the age of two.&nbsp;</p>","Sexual Health, Case 2, Puberty, reproductive system"

High frequency sounds cannot travel as far, whilst low frequency sounds travel further along the basilar membrane. As they travel the basilar membrane moves and causes the stereocilia of the hair cells to touch the tectorial membrane, this causes the opening of channels, and thus information to be sent along nearby afferent nerves. The area of the basilar membrane is therefore determined by the pressure waves, and the basilar membrane contains hair cells that detect different frequencies, allowing the sound to be interpreted by the brain differently.</p><p>As a side note the INTENSITY of the sound (or volume) is determined by the NUMBER of hair cells stimulated&nbsp;</p>","Random, Brain, Case 6, anatomy of the ear"

In the fasting state, when blood sugars are lower, glycogen is released as glucose back into the blood stream. Additionally, the liver uses other substances such as fat, protein or other sugars to produce more glucose in gluconeogenesis.</p><p>Nitrogenous waste from protein catabolism is processed in the liver, with the conversion of ammonium from amino acids to urea. Urea is a less toxic solute than ammonium and can be renally excreted allowing for rapid clearance from the blood stream in healthy individuals.</p><p>A further function of the liver is in producing bilirubin from haem in red blood cells. This reaction occurs in the reticuloendothelial macrophages in the liver, spleen and bone marrow. The processing of bilirubin to make bile occurs exclusively in the liver.</p><p>The liver is involved in the production of plasma proteins such as albumin, many hormones, cytokines and C-reactive protein. Immunoglobulins however are made by plasma cells (B-lymphocytes) and are not produced in the liver as such.</p>","Liver"

Katp channels open, so hyperpolarisation occurs. The increased cAMP also inhibits myosin light chain klinase so a lower contractile force. Adenosine also binds to type A1 receptors in SAN and AVN coupled to a Gi protein. So Adenyl cyclase is inhibited. This causes K+ channels o open, hyperpolarised so less frequent action potentials.

As a 17 year old, he wanted to taste this 'freedom' that all his cool, driving test passing friends are chatting about. So, he ventured out alone in his turbo-engined, tinted windowed Renault Clio (in metallic blue) for the first time on the big old dangerous roads. Brian's bad-ass and he didn't want to use the green p plates (who wants to declare to the world that they've just passed their test?- lame).&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian thought he'd better stick to the national speed limit of 60mph to gain the respect of others on the road. He took a scenic route where the roads were narrow and windy. He underestimated the bend ahead- silly Brian- so, he crashed. Yet another Renault Clio gone to waste (RIP). He was crying due to the shock of losing his Clio. He was also crying because he was in a lot of pain. It was determined that he had sustained a left brachial plexus injury. After initial recovery it was observed that &nbsp;his diaphragm functions normally, there was no winging of the scapula but abduction cannot be initiated. However, if the arm is helped through the first 45 degrees of abduction, Brian can fully abduct the arm. So where on earth has Brian injured his brachial plexus?</p>","<p>Axillary nerve</p>","<p>Posterior cord</p>","<p>Roots of the plexus</p>","<p>Superior Trunk</p>","<p>Suprascapular Nerve</p>","<p>Let's take the observations one by one to break down this question.</p><ul><li>If the diaphragm is functioning normally, you know that the phrenic nerve is probably uninjured, which means that the C5 root has not been damaged.</li><li>Since the scapula is not winged, there was no damage to the long thoracic nerve or the C5-7 nerve roots.</li><li>Since the patient cannot initiate abduction of the arm, you know that the suprascapular nerve is injured and supraspinatus has been denervated. But, the patient can abduct the arm once it is lifted to 45 degrees, so the deltoid muscle and the axillary nerve must be intact.</li></ul><p>Taking the answer choices one by one: The axillary nerve is ok, because deltoid is functioning. The posterior cord of the brachial plexus must also be intact, since this cord gives off the axillary nerve. The roots of the brachial plexus are ok, since the phrenic nerve and long thoracic nerve (which are derived from the roots) are still functioning. The superior trunk of the brachial plexus must also be undamaged, since this trunk contributes to the posterior cord which is intact. So, this means that the injury must be to the suprascapular nerve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Anatomy, Nerve innervation of upper limb, Anatomy of the upper limb, Upper limb"

On the other hand gravity causes a gradient in blood pressure between the top and bottom of the lung of 20 mmHg in the erect position (roughly half of that in the supine position). Overall, mean pulmonary venous pressure is ~5 mmHg. Local venous pressure falls to -5 at the apexes and rises to +15 mmHg at the bases, again for the erect lung. Pulmonary blood pressure is typically in the range 25 - 10 mmHg with a mean pressure of 15 mmHg. Regional arterial blood pressure is typically in the range 5 mmHg near the apex of the lung to 25 mmHg at the base.<br />Zone 1 is not observed in the normal healthy human lung. In normal health pulmonary arterial pressure exceeds alveolar pressure in all parts of the lung. It is generally only observed when a person is ventilated with positive pressure. In these circumstances, blood vessels can become completely collapsed by alveolar pressure and blood does not flow through these regions. They become alveolar dead space.<br />Zone 2 is the part of the lungs about 3 cm above the heart. In this region blood flows in pulses. At first there is no flow because of obstruction at the venous end of the capillary bed. Pressure from the arterial side builds up until it exceeds alveolar pressure and flow resumes. This dissipates the capillary pressure and returns to the start of the cycle.<br />Zone 3 comprises the majority of the lungs in health. There is no external resistance to blood flow and blood flow is continuous throughout the cardiac cycle.<br />The ventilation/perfusion ratio is higher in zone #1 (the apex of lung) when a person is standing than it is in zone #3 (the base of lung.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","Respiratory, Case 5"
